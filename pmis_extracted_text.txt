What’s New in This Report? 
♦ “Deep Distress Score” tables, charts, and maps were added to Chapters 1 through 5.  
“Deep Distress Score” is a subset of the PMIS Distress Score, and only includes distress 
types believed to indicate sub-surface structural rehabilitation needs. 
♦ Chapter 6 maintenance level of service definitions for Shallow Rutting and Deep Rutting 
were changed to treat 1 percent the same as 0 percent. 
♦ Chapter 8 needs estimate treatment ACP705 was changed to trigger preventive 
maintenance treatment for Deep Rutting greater than 1 percent (instead of greater than 0 
percent). 
 
Also of Interest in This Report... 
♦ The PMIS sample for visual distress, ride quality, and rutting increased to 100 percent in 
fiscal year 2001. 
♦ The definitions for Shallow Rutting and Deep Rutting were changed in fiscal year 2001. 
♦ Bar charts and maps have been added for International Roughness Index (IRI), a 
measurement that is used in construction specifications for as-built ride quality. 
♦ Chapter 2 maps contain insets of the urban areas with Interstate loops. 
♦ Chapters 3, 4, and 5 include pictures of pavement distress types for ease of reference. 
♦ Chapter 3 ACP distress maps show the average rating for each distress type. 
♦ Chapter 7 contains expanded information about the Texas Transportation Commission’s 
statewide pavement condition goal, including data storage percentages and prioritized 
lists of the distress types and ride quality items most needing to be improved. 
♦ Chapter 9 contains statewide county and district boundary maps, along with lists of 
county and district names. 
 
How Data Was Analyzed In This Report... 
♦ Data analyzed in this report was obtained from all PMIS sections, mainlane roadbeds, 
Condition Scores greater than 0, excluding sections under construction.  This analysis 
was consistent for the entire report except for the following portions of Chapter 7: 
♦ UTP Category 1 pages were based on all PMIS sections, mainlanes and frontage roads, 
Distress Score or Ride Score greater than 0 (where applicable), excluding sections under 
construction.

Condition of Texas Pavements, FY 2004-2007  i 
 
Executive Summary 
This report describes the condition of Texas pavements in Fiscal Year 2007 and during the four-
year FY 2004-2007 period, based on analysis of Pavement Management Information System 
(PMIS) distress ratings and ride quality measurements.  The report includes the major highway 
systems (IH, US, SH, and FM) and pavement types (ACP, CRCP, and JCP), along with 
maintenance level of service information, pavement-related performance measures, and 
estimates of preventive maintenance and rehabilitation needs. 
“Distress” refers to various types of surface deterioration (such as ruts, cracks, potholes/failures, 
and patches).  “Ride quality” refers to the smoothness of the pavement surface.  “Condition” is a 
mathematical combination of the “distress” and “ride quality” data that describes the average 
person’s perception of pavement quality. 
The overall condition of Texas pavements got slightly worse in FY 2007 mainly because of 
increased distress on asphalt pavements.  Overall pavement distress got worse, but overall ride 
quality improved.  A prolonged drought that began in mid-FY 2005 and lasted through all of FY 
2006, rising material costs, increased competition for limited construction materials, and 
increased oilfield development traffic contributed to the decline in statewide pavement condition. 
Although overall pavement condition declined, the statewide pavement condition goal 
percentage of lane miles in “Good” or better condition increased from 86.69 percent in FY 2006 
to 86.76 percent in FY 2007.   
Pavement condition and distress trends were mixed, but ride quality improved for each of the 
four major highway systems (IH, US, SH, and FM) in FY 2007.  IH and SH routes improved in 
all categories – condition, distress, and ride.  US highways improved in distress and ride, but the 
improvements were all very small, and were not enough to keep the overall condition from 
getting worse.  FM roads improved in ride quality, but got worse in condition and distress. 
ACP condition and distress got worse, but ride quality improved in FY 2007.  CRCP condition 
and distress improved, but ride quality got worse.  JCP condition and ride quality improved, but 
distress got very slightly worse. 
“Deep” distress types in PMIS suggest the need for sub-surface rehabilitation to restore structural 
strength.  The following “deep” distress types got worse in FY 2007:  Deep Rutting, Failures, 
and Longitudinal Cracking for ACP, and Slabs with Longitudinal Cracks for JCP.  No “deep” 
distress types got worse on CRCP. 
The overall “Combined” level of service maintained on Texas flexible (ACP) pavements got 
worse in FY 2007, despite an improved level of service for Alligator Cracking.  “Low-traffic” 
and “Medium-traffic” mileage got worse, while “High-traffic” level of service did not change. 
Condition trends in this report are based on average PMIS Scores, weighted by lane miles.  They 
are not the same as the percentage “good” or better trends shown in the Status of Statewide 
Pavement Condition Goal, FY 2004-2007 – Full Version report.
ii  Condition of Texas Pavements, FY 2004-2007 
History of Changes Affecting PMIS Data and Scores (FY 1993-2002) 
FY 1993: PMIS begins (uses 0.5-mile sections, 100 percent IH sample, 50 percent non-IH  
sample); first estimates of statewide pavement needs (lane miles and dollars).  
 
FY 1996: First automated rut measurements.  PMIS Shallow Rutting and Deep Rutting values 
increased because the automated equipments was able to “see” ruts that raters missed. 
 Increased Shallow Rutting and Deep Rutting values; lowered Distress Scores 
and Condition Scores. 
 
FY 1997: Automated rut measurements much hi gher than FY 1996 because of “old” acoustic 
sensors that had been used in the previous year (sensors replaced every year 
afterwards because of this problem). Also, beginning of ride quality equipment 
conversion to laser profiler (IRI) that was completed in FY 1999. 
 Increased Shallow Rutting and Deep Rutting values; lowered Distress Scores.  
Conversion to laser profiler lowered Ride Scores.  Mixed effect on Condition 
Scores. 
 
FY 1998: Second third of ride quality equi pment converted to laser profiler (IRI). 
 Lowered Ride Scores and Condition Scores.  
 
FY 1999: Remainder of ride quality equipm ent converted to laser profiler (IRI). 
 Lowered Ride Scores and Condition Scores.  
 
FY 2000: CRCP Spalled Cracks definition changed to count only large spalled cracks (3-inch 
instead of 1-inch); Distress Score weighting factors (“utility values”) changed from 
percentage spalled to number per mile. 
 Definition change increased Distress Scores and Condition Scores.  Weighting 
factor change decreased Distress Scores and Condition Scores.  Mixed effect on 
Distress Scores and Condition Scores overall. 
 
FY 2001: Switch to distress ratings done by contractors; sample increased to 100 percent of all 
mileage; rutting definitions changed (Shallow Rutting changed from ½-1 inch to ¼-½ 
inch, Deep Rutting changed from 1-3 inch to ½-1 inch; Severe Rutting added as 1-2 
inch; Failure Rutting added as greater than 3-inch; rut gap left from 2-3 inch); Texas 
Transportation Commission proposes statewide pavement condition goal (90 percent 
“Good” or better in ten years). 
 Minimal effect on PMIS distress data, Distress Scores, and Condition Scores.  
 
FY 2002: Rut gap closed, Failure Rutting changed from greater than 3-inch  to greater than 2-
inch; Two- and ten-year district goals established to meet Texas Transportation 
Commission’s statewide pavement condition goal. 
 Affected Failure Rutting results, but they are not used in PMIS Score 
definitions, so no effect on Distress Scores or Condition Scores.
Condition of Texas Pavements, FY 2004-2007  iii 
History of Changes Affecting PMIS Data and Scores (FY 2003-2007) 
FY 2006: Changed Rutbar dynamic calibration procedure to produce truer “zero” rut depths on 
concrete at highway speeds, but then subtracted 0.1 inches from each rut depth 
measurement to reduce effects of signal noise. 
 Mixed effect on Shallow Rutting and D eep Rutting; minimal effect on Distress 
Scores and Condition Scores.  Calibration procedure produced large increases in 
Shallow Rutting and Deep Rutting, but subtraction of 0.1 inches from rut depth 
measurements more or less cancelled out the calibration procedure increases. 
 
Description of FY 2006-2007 Rutbar Changes 
Two changes to the Rutbar equipment affected PMIS Rutting measurements for FY 2006-2007: 
 
1) Change in Rutbar Dynamic Calibration Procedure 
 
TxDOT changed the calibration procedure for its Rutbar equipment in FY 2006 to provide truer 
“zero” rut depths on concrete pavements.  In previous years, the Rutbar was “statically” 
calibrated to provide “zero” rut depths on a known flat surface while not moving.  The Rutbar 
was then driven on a group of flexible pavement test sections in the Austin area and 
“dynamically” calibrated.  During PMIS data collection, the dynamic calibration would be 
adjusted on an as-needed basis when the operator believed that the rut measurements did not 
look reasonable, based on field observations. 
 
In FY 2006, TxDOT kept the “static” calibration procedure but changed the dynamic calibration 
procedure by measuring rut depths on concrete pavements in the Austin area.  These concrete 
pavements were assumed to have no rutting.  Each Rutbar was subjectively adjusted to produce 
“near zero” rut depths on the concrete sections before being approved for PMIS data collection. 
 
2) Adjustment of Rut Depth Measurements 
 
The new dynamic calibration procedure took out most of the subjective adjustment of the 
Rutbars, but it made the PMIS rut data results much more sensitive to signal noise.  This 
produced large increases in Shallow Rutting and Deep Rutting, especially on coarse-textured seal 
coats. 
 
“Signal noise” refers to the typical variability of the Rutbar instrument due to characteristics of 
the electronic equipment used in the measurement and the way in which signal return strength 
and scatter can be affected by environmental and road conditions.  For the TxDOT Rutbars, the 
instrument is an ultrasonic sensor that “fires” sound waves down to the pavement surface and 
measures the length of time for the sound waves to return to the sensor – the longer the time, the 
deeper the “rut.”    The new procedure raised the typical ±0.1-inch variability of the Rutbar 
ultrasonic sensor much closer to the range of Shallow Rutting.  For example, a “true” 0.15-inch 
rut depth could be reported as anywhere from 0.05 inches (“No Rutting”) to 0.25 inches 
(“Shallow Rutting”) just because of typical sensor variability.  Before FY 2006, this variability 
was not as noticeable because it was usually suppressed by the subjective dynamic calibration 
adjustments.
iv  Condition of Texas Pavements, FY 2004-2007 
In a similar fashion, the new dynamic calibration change caused some Shallow Rutting to be 
reported as Deep Rutting.  For example, a “true” 0.45-inch “Shallow Rut” could be reported as 
anywhere from 0.35 inches (“Shallow Rutting”) to 0.55 inches (“Deep Rutting”) because of 
typical sensor variability. 
 
The following diagrams show the relationship between typical  ±0.1-inch “signal noise” and 
PMIS Rutting.  It takes 0.25 inches to produce a “Shallow Rut” in PMIS, but in FY 2006 nearly 
0.1 inches of that — 38 percent — could be si gnal noise.  Before FY 2006, signal noise was 
basically eliminated from showing up in the Shallow Rut category at all. 
 
 
The FY 2006 changes caused large increases in Rutting reported in PMIS for FY 2006.  Shallow 
Rutting increased from 33.96 percent in FY 2005 to 58.32 percent in FY 2006.  Deep Rutting 
increased from 7.97 percent in FY 2005 to 24.18 percent in FY 2006.  The Deep Rutting increase 
caused a large drop in “Rutting” and “Combined” maintenance level of service, and also caused 
a $239 million increase in preventive maintenance treatments to repair Deep Rutting.
 
 
Review of the FY 2006 rut depth measurements suggested that the new dynamic calibration 
procedure produced rut depths approximately 0.1 inches deeper than they would have been under 
the previous procedure.  As a result, TxDOT decided to “adjust” the FY 2006 rut depth 
measurements by -0.1 inches statewide and then recalculate the percentages of Shallow Rutting 
and Deep Rutting for PMIS.  These “adjusted” rut data are in the PMIS database and are shown 
in this report for FY 2006 and FY 2007 rut data.

Chapter 1  Overall Pavement Condition 
TxDOT measures ride quality and rates pavement distress on all of the State-maintained highway 
network each year.  The ride quality measurements and distress ratings are then stored in the 
Pavement Management Information System (PMIS) database, which (among other things) 
calculates a series of three scores:  Condition Score, Distress Score, and Ride Score.   
Condition Score, which combines ride and distress, ranges from 1 (worst condition) to 100 (best 
condition).  Distress Score ranges from 1 (most distress) to 100 (least distress).  Ride Score 
ranges from 0.1 (roughest) to 5.0 (smoothest).   
These PMIS scores can be used to describe the current condition of Texas pavements, to 
document trends in condition from year to year, and to estimate the total funding needs for 
pavement repair (preventive maintenance and rehabilitation). 
PMIS also contains International Roughness Index (IRI) measurements.  IRI is a value that many 
states and other countries use to describe the amount of roughness measured in a given length of 
pavement.  PMIS contains IRI measurements in units of inches (of roughness) per mile that 
typically range from 1 (smoothest) to approximately 950 (roughest).  IRI is similar to, but is not 
exactly the same as, the PMIS Ride Score, and is used as a roughness specification for pavement 
construction in Texas.  This report includes IRI tables, figures, and maps for use by readers who 
are familiar with it. 
Additional information about PMIS Scores and how they are calculated may be found in PMIS 
Score Equations and Utility Factors.  Specific information about calculation of the PMIS 
Condition Score may be found in Overview of Calculation of PMIS Condition Score.  These 
documents are available from the Construction Division, Materials and Pavements Section.

PMIS Condition Score Classes 
The PMIS Condition Score combines ride quality measurements (“Ride Score”) and pavement 
distress ratings (“Distress Score) into a single description of overall pavement condition.  The 
values range from 1 (worst condition) to 100 (best condition). 
For the purposes of this report, PMIS Condition Score values have been grouped into descriptive 
classes, as shown below: 
Table 1.1 — PMIS Condition Score Classes. 
 
NOTE: The Condition Score is a combination of ride quality and pavement 
distress, adjusted for traffic and speed.  It is not weighted by regional 
factors such as climate and material properties, and it does not describe 
the load-carrying structural capacity of the subsurface pavement layers. 
 
When interpreting PMIS Condition Scores, it should be noted that traffic and speed limit are 
included in the calculated score values.  A road with high traffic (based on Average Daily 
Traffic) or high speed (based on Speed Limit) must have less distress and smoother ride to give 
the same PMIS Condition Score as a road with lower traffic or lower speed.  Although this tends 
to give lower Condition Scores in urban and metropolitan areas, it also provides advance 
warning of pavement problems in high-traffic, high-speed, areas where scheduling treatments 
might be more difficult. 
Additional information about the PMIS Condition Score may be found in PMIS Score Equations 
and Utility Factors and Overview of Calculation of PMIS Condition Score.  These documents are 
available from the Construction Division, Materials and Pavements Section.

Figure 1.3 shows the statewide distribution of Condition Score classes for fiscal years 2004 
through 2007.  The Condition Score is a combination of ride quality measurements and distress 
ratings, adjusted for traffic and speed. 
72.80 percent of the mainlane mileage was in “Very Good” condition in FY 2007. 
 
Figure 1.3 — Condition Score Classes, FY 2004-2007. 
The Condition Score Classes show that: 
♦ “Very Good” mileage decreased (from 73.60% in 2006 to 72.80% in 2007) 
♦ “Good” mileage increased (from 13.62% in 2006 to 14.45% in 2007) 
♦ “Fair” mileage decreased (from 8.21% in 2006 to 8.16% in 2007) 
♦ “Poor” mileage increased (from 2.50% in 2006 to 2.53% in 2007) 
♦ “Very Poor” mileage decreased (from 2.07% in 2006 to 2.06% in 2007).

Condition Score Maps, FY 2006-2007 
Maps 1.1 and 1.2 show average PMIS Condition Scores in each county for fiscal years 2006 and 
2007. The averages are weighted by lane miles for all mainlane pavements in each county.  
Counties in red have the lowest average Condition Scores, while counties in blue have the 
highest average Condition Scores. 
Overall pavement condition got slightly worse in FY 2007 because of increased pavement 
distress, despite an improvement in ride quality.  As will be discussed in Chapters 2-5, condition 
improved for IH, SH, CRCP, and JCP mileage, but got worse for US, FM, and ACP mileage.  
Despite the slight decline in overall condition in FY 2007, many areas of the state still provide 
“Very Good” (90-100) pavement condition, described in terms of distress and ride quality.

PMIS Distress Score Classes 
The PMIS Distress Score describes visible surface deterioration (“pavement distress”) on a scale 
of 1 (most distress) to 100 (least distress). 
For the purposes of this report, PMIS Distress Score values have been grouped into descriptive 
classes, as shown below: 
Table 1.2 — PMIS Distress Score Classes. 
 
 
Distress Score is one of the factors used to calculate the PMIS Condition Score.

Figure 1.4 shows the statewide distribution of Distress Score classes for fiscal years 2004 
through 2007.  Distress Scores are determined from rating visually-apparent pavement distresses 
such as cracking, patching, and various types of failures, and also by measurements of rutting on 
asphalt (“flexible” or “ACP”) pavement.   
79.40 percent of mainlane mileage was “Very Good” in terms of pavement distress in FY 2007. 
  
Figure 1.4 — Distress Score Classes, FY 2004-2007. 
The Distress Score Classes show that: 
♦ “Very Good” mileage decreased (from 80.06% in 2006 to 79.40% in 2007) 
♦ “Good” mileage increased (from 6.59% in 2006 to 7.44% in 2007) 
♦ “Fair” mileage remained the same (4.68% in 2006 to 4.73% in 2007) 
♦ “Poor” mileage decreased (from 4.31% in 2006 to 4.20% in 2007) 
♦ “Very Poor” mileage decreased (from 4.37% in 2006 to 4.25% in 2007).

Work on PMIS began in response to a January 1989 Federal 
mandate that all States have a pavement management system 
in place by February 1993.  PMIS was completed and accepted 
before the Federal deadline.
Condition of Texas Pavements, FY 2004-2007 Chapter 1 13 
Distress Score Maps, FY 2006-2007 
Maps 1.3 and 1.4 show average PMIS Distress Scores in each county for fiscal years 2006 and  
2007. The averages are weighted by lane miles for all mainlane pavements in each county.  
Counties in red have the lowest average Distress Scores, while counties in blue have the highest 
average Distress Scores. 
Overall pavement distress got slightly worse in FY 2007.  As will be discussed in Chapters 2-5, 
pavement distress got worse for FM, ACP, and JCP mileage. 
However, although overall pavement distress got worse, most pavement distress types actually 
improved in FY 2007. 
Eleven pavement distress types improved in FY 2007:  ACP Alligator Cracking, ACP Transverse 
Cracking, ACP Block Cracking, ACP Patching, CRCP Spalled Cracks, CRCP Punchouts, CRCP 
Asphalt Patches, CRCP Concrete Patches, JCP Failed Joints and Cracks, JCP Failures, and JCP 
Shattered Slabs. 
Six pavement distress types got worse in FY 2007:  ACP Shallow Rutting, ACP Deep Rutting, 
ACP Failures, ACP Longitudinal Cracking, JCP Slabs with Longitudinal Cracks, and JCP 
Concrete Patching. 
The Distress Score maps show the overall increase in the amount of pavement distress, with 
many counties getting worse and fewer counties getting better.  However, even with the recent 
increase in pavement distress, most counties are still in the “Very Good” (90-100) range. 
It should be noted that these Distress Score maps do not distinguish between surface (“non load-
associated”) and structural (“load-associated”) distress types, thus they do not specifically 
identify preventive maintenance and rehabilitation needs.  That will be done in Chapter 8 
(Estimate of Total Pavement Needs).

PMIS Deep Distress Score Classes 
Some of the distress types rated in PMIS indicate problems that affect the pavement structure’s 
ability to carry traffic loads.  These “deep” distress types usually require extensive – and 
expensive – sub-surface rehabilitation. 
It is possible to separate the “deep” distress types from the overall PMIS Distress Score and 
create a “Deep Distress Score.”  PMIS sections with a “Deep Distress Score” less than 70 
typically will be beyond the realm of preventive maintenance or surface repairs, and will require 
sub-surface rehabilitation. 
For the purposes of this report, PMIS Deep Distress Score values have been grouped into 
descriptive classes, as shown below: 
Table 1.3 — PMIS Deep Distress Score Classes. 
  
The “Deep” distress types are: 
♦ ACP Deep Rutting 
♦ ACP Failures 
♦ ACP Alligator Cracking 
♦ ACP Longitudinal Cracking 
♦ CRCP Punchouts 
♦ CRCP Asphalt Patches 
♦ JCP Failures 
♦ JCP Shattered Slabs 
♦ JCP Slabs with Longitudinal Cracks.

sub-surface rehabilitation. 
89.48 percent of mainlane mileage was “Very Good” in terms of pavement deep distress in FY 
2007. 
 
Figure 1.5 — Deep Distress Score Classes FY 2004-2007. 
The Deep Distress Score Classes show that: 
♦ “Very Good” mileage increased (from 89.39% in 2006 to 89.48% in 2007) 
♦ “Good” mileage increased (from 3.88% in 2006 to 4.14% in 2007) 
♦ “Fair” mileage decreased (from 2.17% in 2006 to 2.12% in 2007) 
♦ “Poor” mileage decreased (from 2.24% in 2006 to 2.10% in 2007)

Deep Distress Score Maps, FY 2006-2007 
Maps 1.5 and 1.6 show average PMIS Deep Distress Scores in each county for fiscal years 2006 
and  2007. The averages are weighted by lane miles for all mainlane pavements in each county.  
Counties in red have the lowest average Deep Distress Scores, while counties in blue have the 
highest average Deep Distress Scores. 
Overall deep distress got slightly better in FY 2007.  As will be discussed in Chapters 2-5, deep 
distress got better for all highway systems (except FM) and for all pavement types. 
Five deep distress types improved in FY 2007:  ACP Alligator Cracking, CRCP Punchouts, 
CRCP Asphalt Patches, JCP Failures, and JCP Shattered Slabs. 
Four deep distress types got worse in FY 2007:  ACP Deep Rutting, ACP Failures, ACP 
Longitudinal Cracking, and JCP Slabs with Longitudinal Cracks. 
The Deep Distress Score maps show the overall slight improvement (reduction) in deep distress, 
with some counties getting better and only a few getting worse.  The Deep Distress Score maps 
suggest that some areas still will need more extensive sub-surface rehabilitation to improve load-
carrying capacity.  Most counties are still in the “Very Good” (90-100) range.

PMIS Ride Score Classes 
The PMIS Ride Score describes pavement ride quality on a scale from 0.1 (roughest) to 5.0 
(smoothest).  Ride Score is calculated from pavement roughness measured by calibrated 
electronic equipment. 
For the purposes of this report, PMIS Ride Score values have been grouped into descriptive 
classes, as shown below: 
Table 1.4 — PMIS Ride Score Classes. 
 
In general terms, the average person would consider a road to be “rough” when its PMIS Ride 
Score drops below 3.0 (that is, drops into “Fair,” “Poor,” or “Very Poor” class). 
Ride Score is one of the factors used to calculate the PMIS Condition Score. 
Additional information about the PMIS Ride Score may be found in PMIS Score Equations and 
Utility Factors and Overview of Calculation of PMIS Condition Score.  These documents are 
available from the Construction Division, Materials and Pavements Section.

When PMIS began, Rutting on flexible pavements was rated 
visually with a string (or straightedge) and a block of wood.  
Starting in FY 1996, ruts have been measured at highway 
speed using five fixed-position non-contact acoustic sensors 
mounted on the front bumper of a vehicle.

Ride Score Maps, 2006-2007 
Maps 1.7 and 1.8 on the following pages show average PMIS Ride Scores in each county for 
fiscal years 2006 and 2007.  The averages are weighted by lane miles for all mainlane pavements 
in each county.  Counties in red have the lowest average Ride Scores, while counties in blue 
have the highest average Ride Scores. 
Overall ride quality improved in FY 2007.  As will be discussed in Chapters 2-5, ride quality 
improved for all highway systems, and for all pavement types (except CRCP). 
The Ride Score maps show the improvement in statewide ride quality, with many counties rising 
into the Green (average Ride Score 3.5-3.9) category.  No counties had an average ride quality in 
the Red category (average Ride Score 0.1-2.4) in FY 2006 or 2007.

PMIS IRI Score Classes 
The PMIS IRI Score describes pavement ride quality values on a scale from 1 (smoothest) to 950 
(roughest).  The units are inches (of roughness) per mile. 
For the purposes of this report, PMIS IRI Score values have been grouped into classes, as shown 
below: 
Table 1.5 — PMIS IRI Score Classes 
 
NOTE: These IRI Score categories are not  the same as the Ride Score 
categories shown in Table 1.4.  For example, the “Very Good” Ride 
Score category in Table 1.4 (Ride Score 4.0 – 5.0) is not the same as 
the “Very Good” IRI category in this table (IRI 1-59).  As a result, Ride 
Score and IRI will not show the same percentages of mileage in each 
category, but they will show the same trends. 
The IRI Score categories are based on the construction specification for ride quality and on the 
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) strategic goal for ride quality on National Highway 
System (NHS) routes.  The first two categories, “Very Good” and “Good,” are based on the ride 
quality specification.  Mileage in those two categories would not require corrective action under 
the construction specification.  The final category, “Very Poor,” identifies mileage that would 
not meet the FHWA strategic goal for NHS ride quality. 
IRI Score is the average of the IRI values measured in the left and right wheelpaths. 
Although IRI Score is a description of ride quality, it is not one of the factors used to calculate 
the PMIS Condition Score.

1-59 Very Good
60-95 Good
96-130 Fair
131-169 Poor
170-950 Very Poor

Figure 1.7 shows the statewide distribution of IRI Score classes for fiscal years 2004 through 
2007.  IRI Scores are measured using calibrated automated ride value measuring equipment 
developed by TxDOT.  The IRI categories in this Figure are based on the construction 
specification for ride quality, and are not the same as the PMIS Ride Score categories. 
6.64 percent of the mainlane mileage had “Very Good” IRI Scores in FY 2007. 
 
Figure 1.7 — IRI Score Classes, FY 2004-2007. 
The IRI Score Classes show that: 
♦ “Very Good” mileage increased (from 6.32% in 2006 to 6.64% in 2007) 
♦ “Good” mileage increased (from 26.68% in 2006 to 27.36% in 2007) 
♦ “Fair” mileage increased (from 30.34% in 2006 to 30.54% in 2007) 
♦ “Poor” mileage decreased (from 23.18% in 2006 to 22.35% in 2007) 
♦ “Very Poor” mileage decreased (from 13.49% in 2006 to 13.11% in 2007).

Average Condition Scores of the Highway Systems 
PMIS classifies Texas roads into the following seven highway systems: 
♦ Interstate Highways (IH) 
♦ United States highways (US) 
♦ State Highways (SH) 
♦ Farm-to-Market (FM), including Ranch Roads (RR) and Ranch-to-Market (RM) 
♦ Business Routes (BR) 
♦ Park Roads (PR), including Recreational Roads (RE) 
♦ Principal Arterial Streets (PA). 
 
Figure 1.8 shows average PMIS Condition Scores for each highway system for fiscal years 2004 
through 2007.   Average pavement condition got worse statewide and for US and FM routes, but 
improved for IH and SH routes in FY 2007. 
Condition, distress, and ride quality trends for the four major highway systems (IH, US, SH, and 
FM) will be discussed in Chapter 2.

Average Condition Scores of the Major Pavement Types 
PMIS also classifies Texas roads into the following three major pavement types: 
♦ Flexible Pavements, also known as Asphalt Concrete Pavements (ACP) 
♦ Continuously Reinforced Concrete Pavements (CRCP) 
♦ Jointed Concrete Pavements (JCP). 
 
Figure 1.9 shows average PMIS Condition Scores for each pavement type for fiscal years 2004 
through 2007.  Average pavement condition got worse in FY 2007 statewide and for ACP, but 
improved for CRCP and JCP.

Lane Miles in PMIS, by Highway System 
Table 1.6 shows the total lane miles in PMIS for each of the highway systems.  These mileages 
are obtained at the beginning of each fiscal year from TxDOT’s Texas Reference Marker (TRM) 
system.  Updates to TRM are not picked up in PMIS until the start of a new fiscal year.  Some 
differences may occur when comparing PMIS to other TxDOT management systems, because 
PMIS sections are only accurate to a tenth of a mile.

Rated/Measured Lane Miles in PMIS, by Highway System 
In fiscal year 2001, TxDOT began rating and measuring PMIS data (visual distress, ride quality, 
and rutting) for all mileage, except for sections that were under construction during the PMIS 
data collection season (usually September-February).  Unlike previous years (FY 1993-2000), 
PMIS is now rating and measuring the same roads every year. 
Table 1.8 shows the total lane miles (mainlanes only) rated/measured in PMIS, by highway 
system.  A section must have a PMIS Condition Score (that is, it must have both distress data and 
ride data stored) to be included in this table. 
Table 1.8 — Rated/Measured Lane Miles in PMIS, by Highway System, FY 2004-2007.

Table 1.9 — Rated/Measured Lane Miles in  PMIS, by Pavement Type, FY 2004-2007. 
 
NOTE: Analysis of frontage roads is not included in this report (except for 
most Tables in Chapter 7) because of insufficient traffic and PMIS 
data.  Obtaining consistent traffic data and PMIS data (ride and 
distress) on frontage roads is difficult because of the many 
entrance/exit ramps and intersecting streets, and because some frontage 
roads are discontinuous.

Rated/Measured Lane Miles in PMIS, by Data/Score Type 
Although TxDOT began rating and measuring all State-maintained mileage for PMIS in FY 
2001, it is not possible to rate or measure every mile of the system because of construction and 
other site-specific conditions that make it difficult to get good ratings and measurements. 
Table 1.10 shows the total lane miles (mainlanes only) rated/measured in PMIS, by data type and 
PMIS Score type.  A section must have a PMIS Condition Score (that is, it must have both 
distress data and ride data stored) to be included in this table.

Condition of Texas Pavements, FY 2004-2007 Chapter 1 39 
Discussion 
The overall condition of Texas pavements got slightly worse in FY 2007 mainly because of 
increased distress on asphalt pavements.  Overall pavement distress got worse, but overall ride 
quality improved. 
As will be discussed in Chapters 2-5, condition improved for IH, SH, CRCP, and JCP mileage, 
but got worse for US, FM, and ACP mileage.  Ride quality improved for all highway systems, 
and for all pavement types (except CRCP).  Pavement distress got worse for FM, ACP, and JCP 
mileage, and these drops drove the slight decline in overall statewide condition. 
Several factors contributed to the decline in statewide pavement condition in FY 2007.  A 
prolonged drought began in mid-FY 2005, intensified by the end of FY 2005, and lasted until the 
end of FY 2006.  
Rising material costs also contributed to the statewide decline in condition by reducing the 
amount of mileage that could be repaired with existing maintenance and rehabilitation funds.  In 
FY 2005, overall construction costs rose by more than 21 percent.  Hot-mix asphalt concrete 
costs rose more than 27 percent, asphalt cement used for seal coats rose more than 38 percent, 
and concrete pavement rose 11 percent.  These sharp rises in cost affected pavement conditions 
observed during the FY 2006 PMIS evaluations. 
Material costs continued to increase in FY 2006.  Overall construction costs rose by another 17 
percent.  Hot-mix asphalt concrete costs rose by another 34 percent, asphalt cement used for seal 
coats rose by another 41 percent, and concrete pavement rose by another 13 percent.  These 
trends, along with increased competition for limited construction materials and increased oilfield 
development traffic, helped increase distress and lower pavement condition in FY 2007. 
In fiscal year 2001, TxDOT began rating and measuring PMIS data (visual distress, ride quality, 
and rutting) for all mileage, except for sections that were under construction during the PMIS 
data collection season (usually September-February).  Unlike previous years (FY 1993-2000), 
PMIS is now rating and measuring the same roads every year.  The sample size for PMIS 
Condition Score in FY 2007 was 95.88 percent of State-maintained lane mileage, up slightly 
from 95.52 percent in FY 2006. 
Summary 
The overall condition of Texas pavements got slightly worse in FY 2007 mainly because of 
increased distress on asphalt pavements.  Overall pavement distress got worse, but overall ride 
quality improved.  A prolonged drought that began in mid-FY 2005 and lasted through all of FY 
2006, rising material costs, increased competition for limited construction materials, and 
increased oilfield development traffic contributed to the decline in statewide pavement condition.

The pavement Profiler also measures Rutting on flexible 
(asphalt) pavements.  The five Rut sensors are numbered 1-5 
from the left side of the vehicle to the right side.  Sensor 2 
measures rut depth in the left wheelpath and Sensor 4 
measures rut depth in the right wheelpath.  Ruts are measured 
approximately every four feet and they are summarized every 
0.1-mile for use in PMIS.

Chapter 2  Condition of the Highway Systems 
This chapter describes the condition of the four major highway systems in Texas.  These 
highway systems are: 
♦ Interstate Highways (IH) 
♦ United States Highways (US) 
♦ State Highways (SH) 
♦ Farm-to-Market (FM), including Ranch Roads (RR) and Ranch-to-Market (RM). 
 
Average Condition Scores, by Highway System 
Figure 2.1 shows the average PMIS Condition Scores, by highway system, for fiscal years 2004 
through 2007.  Average pavement condition got worse statewide and for US and FM routes, but 
improved for IH and SH routes in FY 2007.  This is the same chart from Figure 1.8, and is 
repeated here for ease of reference. 
 
Figure 2.1 — Average Condition Scores, by Highway System, FY 2004-2007. 
Although Business Routes (BR), Park Roads (PR), and Principal Arterial streets (PA) are 
included in the PMIS database (and in this Figure), they are not discussed in the rest of this 
chapter because the small amounts of data available tend to cause large fluctuations in results 
from year to year.

TxDOT’s pavement Profilers measure ride quality using two 
lasers, one mounted over each wheelpath.  The lasers operate 
at 16 kilohertz - that is, they measure ride quality 16,000 times 
per second.  At a typical highway speed of 60 miles per hour, 
the lasers measure ride quality approximately 15 times per 
inch.

75.72 percent of the IH lane miles were in “Very Good” condition in FY 2007. 
 
Figure 2.2 — IH System Condition Score Classes, FY 2004-2007. 
The Condition Score Classes for Interstate Highways show that: 
♦ “Very Good” mileage increased (from 74.04% in 2006 to 75.72% in 2007) 
♦ “Good” mileage decreased (from 13.61% in 2006 to 12.72% in 2007) 
♦ “Fair” mileage decreased (from 7.68% in 2006 to 6.93% in 2007) 
♦ “Poor” mileage increased (from 2.30% in 2006 to 2.44% in 2007) 
♦ “Very Poor” mileage decreased (from 2.37% in 2006 to 2.19% in 2007).

Figure 2.4 shows the statewide distribution of Deep Distress Score classes for the Interstate 
system for fiscal years 2004 through 2007.  Deep Distress Scores are based on specific distress 
types that suggest the need for sub-surface rehabilitation. 
86.83 percent of the IH lane miles were “Very Good” in terms of pavement deep distress in FY 
2007. 
 
Figure 2.4 — IH System Deep Di stress Score Classes, FY 2004-2007. 
The Deep Distress Score Classes for Interstate Highways show that: 
♦ “Very Good” mileage increased (from 86.55% in 2006 to 86.83% in 2007) 
♦ “Good” mileage increased (from 5.33% in 2006 to 5.45% in 2007) 
♦ “Fair” mileage decreased (from 3.57% in 2006 to 3.20% in 2007) 
♦ “Poor” mileage decreased (from 2.12% in 2006 to 2.03% in 2007) 
♦ “Very Poor” mileage increased (from 2.43% in 2006 to 2.49% in 2007).

PMIS uses Texas Reference Markers to locate the beginning 
and ending of each rating section.  Reference Marker numbers 
increase northbound and eastbound for IH routes; southbound 
and eastbound for all other routes.

Figure 2.5 shows the statewide distribution of the Ride Score classes for the Interstate system for 
fiscal years 2004 through 2007.  In general, the average person would consider 5.99 percent of 
IH pavements in Texas to be “rough.” 
 
57.61 percent of the IH lane miles had “Very Good” ride quality in FY 2007. 
 
Figure 2.5 — IH System Ride Score Classes, FY 2004-2007. 
The Ride Score Classes for Interstate Highways show that: 
♦ “Very Good” mileage decreased (from 57.66% in 2006 to 57.61% in 2007) 
♦ “Good” mileage increased (from 35.45% in 2006 to 36.40% in 2007) 
♦ “Fair” mileage decreased (from 6.79% in 2006 to 5.88% in 2007) 
♦ “Poor” mileage increased (from 0.09% in 2006 to 0.10% in 2007) 
♦ “Very Poor” mileage remained the same (0.01% in 2006 to 0.01% in 2007).

The first PMIS Annual Report was actually a PES Annual 
Report that summarized the results of the 1982 pavement 
evaluation survey.  That survey began on October 1, 1982, and 
finished on January 20, 1983.
Condition of Texas Pavements, FY 2004-2007 Chapter 2 59 
Figure 2.6 shows the statewide distribution of the IRI Score classes for the Interstate system for 
fiscal years 2004 through 2007.  In general, the average person would consider 32.00 percent of 
IH pavements in Texas to be “rough,” based on IRI.  This is not the same as the 5.99 percent of 
“rough” IH mileage based on Ride Score because the IRI categories are based on the 
construction specification for ride quality, and are not the same as the PMIS Ride Score 
categories. 
20.68 percent of the IH lane miles had “Very Good” IRI Scores in FY 2007. 
 
Figure 2.6 — IH System IRI Score Classes, FY 2004-2007. 
The IRI Score Classes for Interstate Highways show that: 
♦ “Very Good” mileage decreased (from 21.14% in 2006 to 20.68% in 2007) 
♦ “Good” mileage increased (from 45.72% in 2006 to 47.32% in 2007) 
♦ “Fair” mileage increased (from 20.87% in 2006 to 21.07% in 2007) 
♦ “Poor” mileage decreased (from 9.89% in 2006 to 8.73% in 2007) 
♦ “Very Poor” mileage decreased (from 2.38% in 2006 to 2.19% in 2007).

Discussion 
Pavement condition and distress trends were mixed, but ride quality improved for each of the 
four major highway systems (IH, US, SH, and FM) in FY 2007. 
For Interstate highways (IH), FY 2007 condition, distress, and ride quality all improved.  Deep 
Distress Scores on the IH system also improved in FY 2007.  IH had the best overall ride quality 
of the major highway systems in FY 2007, as it has had since FY 1998.  IH had the worst overall 
distress and “deep” distress of the major highway systems in FY 2007, as it has had since FY 
2004. 
For US highways, FY 2007 condition got worse, but distress and ride quality improved.  Deep 
Distress Scores on US highways also improved in FY 2007.  The US system had the best overall 
condition of the major highway systems in FY 2007 (as it has had since FY 2004), and also had 
the best overall distress in FY 2007. 
For State highways (SH), FY 2007 condition, distress, and ride quality all improved.  Deep 
Distress Scores on SH routes also improved in FY 2007.  The SH system no longer had the worst 
overall condition of the major highway systems in FY 2007, as it has had since FY 2004. 
For Farm-to-Market roads (FM), FY 2007 condition and distress got worse, but ride quality 
improved.  Deep Distress Scores on FM roads got worse, though.  Despite the worsening Deep 
Distress Scores in FY 2007, FM roads still had the best overall “deep” distress, as they have had 
since FY 2004.  FM roads had the worst overall ride quality of the major highway systems in FY 
2007 (as they have had since FY 2001) and the worst overall condition. 
Summary 
Pavement condition and distress trends were mixed, but ride quality improved for each of the 
four major highway systems (IH, US, SH, and FM) in FY 2007. 
IH and SH routes improved in all categories – condition, distress, ride, and “deep” distress – in 
FY 2007.  US highways improved in distress, “deep” distress, and ride, but the improvements 
were all very small, and were not enough to keep the overall condition from getting worse.  FM 
roads improved in ride quality, but got worse in condition, distress, and “deep” distress.

Chapter 3  Condition of Flexible Pavements — ACP 
This chapter describes the condition of flexible pavements in Texas.  Flexible pavements 
(sometimes known as “asphalt concrete pavement” or ACP) are surfaced with asphalt concrete.  
They make up 92.31 percent of the TxDOT-maintained lane mileage but carry only 72.38 
percent of the vehicle miles traveled. 
Flexible Pavement Distress Types 
The following distress type ratings are used in the analysis: 
♦ Shallow Rutting 
♦ Deep Rutting 
♦ Alligator Cracking 
♦ Failures 
♦ Longitudinal Cracking 
♦ Transverse Cracking 
♦ Block Cracking 
♦ Patching. 
 
Definition of “Shallow” and “Deep” Pavement Distress Types  
Flexible pavement distress can be caused by many factors, and local conditions have a major 
impact.  However, for this report, it is helpful to think of PMIS flexible pavement distress types 
in terms of: 
♦ “Shallow” Distress Types – Shallow Rutting, Transverse Cracking, Block Cracking, and 
Patching.  “Shallow” distress types usually indicate surface problems that are not directly 
caused by structural deficiency.  In some cases, “shallow” distress types are caused by 
climate factors, such as temperature or rainfall, or by excessive age.  “Shallow” distress 
usually does not require sub-surface structural rehabilitation and can be fixed by surface-
type preventive maintenance treatments.  However, “shallow” distress types can turn into 
“deep” distress types if not properly maintained. 
♦ “Deep” Distress Types – Deep Rutting, Alligator Cracking, Failures, and Longitudinal 
Cracking.  “Deep” distress types usually indicate sub-surface problems that reduce the 
pavement structure’s ability to carry traffic loads.  In many cases, “deep” distress types 
are caused by drainage problems, excessive moisture (rainfall), or moisture-reactive 
subgrades.  “Deep” distress is usually beyond the realm of preventive maintenance and 
requires sub-surface structural rehabilition. 
 
Distinguishing “Shallow” and “Deep” distress types can suggest how current funding needs to be 
distributed between preventive maintenance and rehabilitation.  It can also identify regions of the 
state where load-related structural problems are prevalent.

Figure 3.2 shows the statewide distribution of the Distress Score classes for flexible pavements 
for fiscal years 2004 through 2007. 
It should be noted that PMIS Distress Score values are not a complete description of flexible 
pavement condition because aggressive resurfacing can cover up visible distress and make a road 
look much better on top than it really is underneath.  Such pavements tend to show rapid 
increases in load-associated distress because of failing structure or increased traffic load. 
79.23 percent of the flexible lane miles were “Very Good” in terms of pavement distress in FY 
2007. 
 
Figure 3.2 — Distress Score Classes for Flexible Pavement, FY 2004-2007.

What are those roads that parallel the Interstate mainlanes? 
 
TxDOT officially calls them “frontage roads,” but several cities 
have their own names for them.  In Houston, they are called 
“feeder” roads; in Dallas-Fort Worth, “service” roads; in San 
Antonio, “access” roads; and in El Paso, “gateway” roads.

Shallow Rutting 
Figure 3.6 shows the percentage of PMIS sections with Shallow Rutting for fiscal years 2004 
through 2007.   Shallow Rutting is a “shallow” distress type.  It is defined as a depression in the 
wheelpath of ¼- to ½-inch in depth.  
47.91 percent of the flexible pavement sections had Shallow Rutting in FY 2007. 
 
Figure 3.6 — Shallow Rutting, FY 2004-2007. 
The Wheelpath Length of Shallow Rutting for Flexible Pavement shows that the: 
♦ “0 to 1” decreased (from 67.86% in 2006 to 52.09% in 2007) 
♦ “2 to 10” increased (from 30.34% in 2006 to 43.38% in 2007) 
♦ “11 to 17” increased (from 1.27% in 2006 to 3.29% in 2007) 
♦ “18 to 27” increased (from 0.34% in 2006 to 0.95% in 2007) 
♦ “28 to 100” increased (from 0.18% in 2006 to 0.29% in 2007). 
 
TxDOT experience with the automated rut-measuring equipment (“Rutbar”) suggests that these 
PMIS results do not show all of the Shallow Rutting that actually exists on the road.  Because the 
sensors on the Rutbar are fixed in positions less than the full width of the lane, some Shallow 
Rutting on the road is not shown in these PMIS measurements, and some of the Shallow Rutting 
shown here might actually be Deep Rutting on the road.

Maps 3.1 and 3.2 show the average measurement for Shallow Rutting, weighted by lane miles, in 
each county.  The average in this case is the percentage of wheelpath length with Shallow 
Rutting.  For example, if a county has 100 lane miles, it has 200 total miles of wheelpath that 
could have Shallow Rutting; an average measurement of 10 percent would mean that the county 
has 20 miles of Shallow Rutting. 
Shallow Rutting got worse in FY 2007, after improving slightly in FY 2006.  It must be noted 
that the FY 2006-2007 Shallow Rutting data in PMIS had to be adjusted by subtracting 0.1 
inches from each rut depth measurement.  This was done to compensate for a change in the 
Rutbar dynamic calibration procedure which produced a very large increase in the amount of 
Shallow Rutting. 
Additional information about the rut data changes may be found in “Description of FY 2006-
2007 Rutbar Changes” on page iii. 
Coarse aggregate seal coats and surface treatments often show up as having higher amounts of 
Rutting in PMIS because the coarse texture of the surface scatters some of the signal from the 
Rutbar sensors – this “loss” of signal is interpreted as Rutting (either Shallow or Deep).  This is 
an operational characteristic of the ultrasonic sensors used in the Rutbar device.

PMIS results do not show all of the Deep Rutting that actually exists on the road.  Because the 
sensors on the Rutbar are fixed in positions less than the full width of the lane, some Deep 
Rutting on the road is not shown in these PMIS measurements.

Maps 3.3 and 3.4 show the average measurement for Deep Rutting, weighted by lane miles, in 
each county.  The average in this case is the percentage of wheelpath length with Deep Rutting.  
For example, if a county has 100 lane miles, it has 200 total miles of wheelpath that could have 
Deep Rutting; an average measurement of 10 percent would mean that the county has 20 miles of 
Deep Rutting. 
Deep Rutting got worse in FY 2007, as it did in FY 2006.  It must be noted that the FY 2006-
2007 Deep Rutting data in PMIS had to be adjusted by subtracting 0.1 inches from each rut depth 
measurement.  This was done to compensate for a change in the Rutbar dynamic calibration 
procedure which produced a very large increase in the amount of Deep Rutting. 
Additional information about the rut data changes may be found in “Description of FY 2006-
2007 Rutbar Changes” on page iii. 
Coarse aggregate seal coats and surface treatments often show up as having higher amounts of 
Rutting in PMIS because the coarse texture of the surface scatters some of the signal from the 
Rutbar sensors – this “loss” of signal is interpreted as Rutting (either Shallow or Deep).  This is 
an operational characteristic of the ultrasonic sensors used in the Rutbar device.

Alligator Cracking 
Figure 3.8 shows the percentage of PMIS sections with Alligator Cracking for fiscal years 2004 
through 2007.   Alligator Cracking is a “deep” distress type.  It is defined as interconnecting 
cracks that form small irregularly shaped blocks (less than one foot by one foot) which resemble 
an alligator’s skin. 
Alligator Cracking is sometimes also referred to as “fatigue cracking.” 
14.25 percent of the flexible pavement sections had Alligator Cracking in FY 2007. 
 
Figure 3.8 — Alligator Cracking, FY 2004-2007. 
The Wheelpath Length of Alligator Cracking for Flexible Pavement shows that the: 
♦ “None” category increased (from 85.47% in 2006 to 85.75% in 2007) 
♦ “1 to 4” percent category increased (from 8.72% in 2006 to 8.74% in 2007) 
♦ “5 to 8” percent category increased (from 2.25% in 2006 to 2.36% in 2007) 
♦ “9 to 14” percent category decreased (from 1.33% in 2006 to 1.32% in 2007)

Maps 3.5 and 3.6 show the average rating for Alligator Cracking, weighted by lane miles, in each 
county.  The average in this case is the percentage of wheelpath length with Alligator Cracking.  
For example, if a county has 100 lane miles, it has 200 total miles of wheelpath that could have 
Alligator Cracking; an average rating of 10 percent would mean that the county has 20 miles of 
Alligator Cracking. 
Alligator Cracking improved in FY 2007, after having gotten worse in FY 2006. 
Maintenance patching and spot resurfacing can reduce Alligator Cracking and thus reduce the 
threat of water seeping into the base and subgrade, but these treatments can give the misleading 
impression that the pavement’s structural strength has been restored.  Areas which previously 
had Alligator Cracking need to be watched carefully because the underlying structural problems 
can cause pavement failure very rapidly, especially when heavy traffic loads occur unexpectedly.

Failures 
Figure 3.9 shows the percentage of PMIS sections with Failures for fiscal years 2004 through 
2007.   Failures are a “deep” distress type.  Failures are defined as localized sections of pavement 
where the surface and base have been severely eroded, badly cracked, depressed, or severely 
shoved.  PMIS also considers potholes greater than one foot in diameter as Failures. 
Beginning in FY 2001, the definition of Failures was expanded to include ruts greater than two 
inches deep and some types of faulted longitudinal cracks. 
4.88 percent of the flexible pavement sections had Failures in FY 2007. 
 
Figure 3.9 — Failures, FY 2004-2007. 
The Number of Failures per Mile for Flexible Pavement shows that the: 
♦ “None” category decreased (from 95.23% in 2006 to 95.12% in 2007) 
♦ “0 to 2” category increased (from 2.83% in 2006 to 2.88% in 2007) 
♦ “2 to 3” category increased (from 0.14% in 2006 to 0.15% in 2007) 
♦ “3 to 4” category decreased (from 0.90% in 2006 to 0.89% in 2007) 
♦ “>4” category increased (from 0.90% in 2006 to 0.95% in 2007).

Maps 3.7 and 3.8 show the average rating for Failures, weighted by lane miles, in each county.  
The average in this case is the total number of Failures in a PMIS section.  For example, if a 
county has 1000 PMIS sections, an average rating of 1 Failure per section means that the county 
has 1000 Failures. 
Failures got worse in FY 2007, after having improved in FY 2004-2006.  Failures can be 
eliminated through extensive routine maintenance (especially patching), but they can also 
develop rapidly when necessary maintenance or rehabilitation has been delayed for too long.  
Also, regions tend to have either many Failures or very few, because Failures are usually caused 
by adverse regional materials, climate, or load. 
Failures are relatively uncommon in Texas because they are usually patched as soon as possible.  
In some cases, an area with Alligator Cracking will turn into a Failure when the cracks become 
wide enough to expose the base material.  In other cases, cracks (especially Longitudinal Cracks) 
are defined as Failures if they are spalled or faulted.

Longitudinal Cracking 
Figure 3.10 shows the percentage of PMIS sections with Longitudinal Cracking for fiscal years 
2004 through 2007.   Longitudinal Cracking is a “deep” distress type.  The cracks run parallel to 
the pavement centerline (for example, reflective cracking, edge cracking, or wheelpath cracking). 
It should be noted that PMIS does not distinguish between sealed and unsealed cracks.  Thus 
crack sealing will not change the rating of a PMIS section with Longitudinal Cracking.  A seal 
coat or thin overlay, of course, will eliminate the Longitudinal Cracking in PMIS. 
37.68 percent of the flexible pavement sections had Longitudinal Cracking in FY 2007. 
 
Figure 3.10 — Longitudinal Cracking, FY 2004-2007. 
The Longitudinal Cracking per 100-foot Station for Flexible Pavement shows that the: 
♦ “None” category decreased (from 64.52% in 2006 to 62.32% in 2007) 
♦ “1 to 85” feet category increased (from 31.91% in 2006 to 33.87% in 2007)

Maps 3.9 and 3.10 show the average rating for Longitudinal Cracking, weighted by lane miles, in 
each county.  The average in this case is the total length of Longitudinal Cracking per 100-foot 
station.  For example, if a county has 100 lane miles, it has 528,000 feet of travel lanes, and 5280 
100-foot stations that could have Longitudinal Cracking; an average rating of 1 foot per 100-foot 
station would mean that the county has 5280 feet of Longitudinal Cracking.  
Longitudinal Cracking got worse in FY 2007, as it did in FY 2006.  Some of the increase in 
Longitudinal Cracking was caused by shrinkage cracks produced by the prolonged drought that 
began in Spring 2005 and continued through all of FY 2006. 
Typically, only the central and western regions of Texas can tolerate Longitudinal Cracking 
without progression to more serious distresses.  This is because of the high-grade limestone 
materials locally available for the pavement structure, and because of the relatively warm and 
dry climate. Local paving practices also affect the amount of Longitudinal Cracking, especially 
in areas that have large amounts of overlaid concrete pavement.  If the concrete pavement was in 
poor condition when it was overlaid – which is usually the case – reflective Longitudinal 
Cracking in the asphalt surface occurs rapidly. 
It should be noted that sealed Longitudinal Cracks are still rated in PMIS.  This causes a problem 
in some areas because the PMIS ratings give the impression that there is more cracking than 
there really is.  If the sealed cracks remain sealed, then water cannot seep in to erode the 
pavement structure.  But if the sealed cracks open up again, they must be resealed.

Transverse Cracking 
Figure 3.11 shows the percentage of PMIS sections with Transverse Cracking for fiscal years 
2004 through 2007.  Transverse Cracking is a “shallow” distress type.  Transverse Cracking 
travels at right angles to the road’s centerline, and generally occurs as reflective cracking from 
overlaid concrete pavements (spalled cracks from overlaid CRCP or joints from overlaid JCP).  
These overlaid concrete pavements are sometimes called “composite pavements.” 
It should be noted that PMIS does not distinguish between sealed and unsealed cracks.  Thus 
crack sealing will not change the rating of a PMIS section with Transverse Cracking.  A seal coat 
or thin overlay, of course, will eliminate the Transverse Cracking in PMIS. 
9.27 percent of the flexible pavement sections had Transverse Cracking in FY 2007. 
 
Figure 3.11— Transverse Cracking, FY 2004-2007. 
The Number of Transverse Cracks per 100-foot Station for Flexible Pavement shows that the: 
♦ “None” increased (from 90.67% in 2006 to 90.73% in 2007) 
♦ “1 to 5” increased (from 8.56% in 2006 to 8.64% in 2007)

Maps 3.11 and 3.12 show the average rating for Transverse Cracking, weighted by lane miles, in 
each county.  The average in this case is the number of Transverse Cracks per 100-foot station.  
For example, if a county has 100 lane miles, it has 528,000 feet of travel lanes, and 5280 100-
foot stations that could have Transverse Cracks; an average rating of 1 per 100-foot station 
would mean that the county has 5280 full-lane width Transverse Cracks. 
Transverse Cracking improved in FY 2007, as it did in FY 2006. 
In north Texas, Transverse Cracking is aggravated by the extreme changes in temperature.  In 
southeast Texas, Transverse Cracking is generally caused by the use of cement-treated bases. 
Transverse Cracks that are wide and deep – which often occurs with cement-treated base – cause 
serious ride quality problems, even when the cracks are sealed.  Local paving practices also 
affect the amount of Transverse Cracking, especially in areas that have large amounts of overlaid 
concrete pavement.  If the concrete pavement was in poor condition when it was overlaid – 
which is most often the case – reflective Transverse Cracking in the asphalt surface occurs 
rapidly. 
It should be noted that sealed Transverse Cracks are still rated in PMIS.  This causes a problem 
in some areas because the PMIS ratings give the impression that there is more cracking than 
there really is.  If the sealed cracks remain sealed, then water cannot seep in to erode the 
pavement structure.  But if the sealed cracks open up again, they must be resealed.

side, instead of less than one foot on each side (which is defined as Alligator Cracking). 
0.48 percent of the flexible pavement sections had Block Cracking in FY 2007.

Maps 3.13 and 3.14 show the average rating for Block Cracking, weighted by lane miles, in each 
county.  The average in this case is the percentage of lane area covered by Block Cracking.  For 
example, if a county has 100 lane miles, it has 100 total miles of lane area that could have Block 
Cracking; an average rating of 10 percent would mean that the county has 10 miles of full-lane 
width Block Cracking. 
Block Cracking improved in FY 2007, as it did in FY 2005 and  FY 2006.  It is found only in 
isolated areas.  It is easy to confuse Block Cracking with Longitudinal and Transverse Cracking, 
so it is possible that PMIS underestimates the amount of Block Cracking on Texas pavements. 
Block Cracking is mainly caused by extreme changes in temperature, but it can also be caused by 
shrinkage related to the use of cement-treated base.  Although Block Cracking is not a load-
associated distress, it can cause structural failure if it is left untreated for too long, especially in 
areas of high rainfall and freezing temperatures. 
It should be noted that sealed Block Cracks are still rated in PMIS.  This causes a problem in 
some areas because the PMIS ratings give the impression that there is more cracking than there 
really is.  If the sealed cracks remain sealed, then water cannot seep in to erode the pavement 
structure.  But if the sealed cracks open up again, they must be resealed.

Patching 
Figure 3.13 shows the percentage of PMIS sections with Patching for fiscal years 2004 through 
2007.  Patching is a “shallow” distress type.  Patches are repairs made to pavement distress.  
They indicate prior maintenance activity, and can be used as a general measure of pavement age 
(maintenance tends to increase as a pavement ages). 
Patching is not a “deep” distress, but it can be caused by repair of “deep” distress.  It can also be 
used to repair other “shallow” distress types. 
15.09 percent of the flexible pavement sections had Patching in FY 2007.

Maps 3.15 and 3.16 show the average rating for Patching, weighted by lane miles, in each 
county.  The average in this case is the percentage of lane area covered by Patching.  For 
example, if a county has 100 lane miles, it has 100 total miles of lane area that could have 
Patching; an average rating of 10 percent would mean that the county has 10 miles of full-lane 
width Patching. 
Patching improved in FY 2007, after having gotten slightly worse in FY 2006. 
It should be noted that local maintenance practices can drastically affect the amount of Patching 
in PMIS.  Flexible pavement material used to fill in ruts will be rated as Patching.  Preventive 
maintenance edge stabilization that encroaches into the travel lane will be rated as Patching, even 
if it continues for several miles.  Strip-type surface treatments and microsurfacing to improve 
surface texture will also be rated as Patching, even though the underlying material might still be 
structurally sound.  Not all Patching in PMIS is caused by filling in potholes or digging up base 
material to repair “deep” distress.

Discussion 
In FY 2007, ACP condition and distress got worse, but ride quality improved.  “Deep” distress 
on ACP mileage also improved.  ACP had the best overall condition and ride quality of the three 
major pavement types in FY 2007. 
Four of the eight ACP distress types got worse in FY 2007:  Shallow Rutting, Deep Rutting, 
Failures, and Longitudinal Cracking.  The other four distress ACP distress types – Alligator 
Cracking, Transverse Cracking, Block Cracking, and Patching – improved in FY 2007.  
Three ACP “deep” distress types – Deep Rutting, Failures, and Longitudinal Cracking – got 
worse in FY 2007.    Improved Alligator Cracking offest these other distress types and improved 
the overall “deep” distress for ACP. 
ACP mileage was hit hard by the prolonged drought that began in the middle of FY 2005 and 
continued through all of FY 2006.  Large increases in pavement material costs also affected 
flexible (asphalt) pavements by reducing the amount of mileage that could be resurfaced with 
existing maintenance and rehabilitation budgets.  As mentioned in Chapter 1, overall 
construction costs rose by more than 21 percent in FY 2005 and by another 17 percent in FY 
2006.  Hot-mix asphalt rose by more than 27 percent in FY 2005 and by 34 percent in FY 2006.  
Asphalt cement for seal coats rose by more than 38 percent in FY 2005 and by 41 percent in FY 
2006. 
It must be noted that PMIS rut data for FY 2006-2007 had to be adjusted by subtracting 0.1 
inches from each rut depth measurement.  This was done to compensate for a change in the 
Rutbar dynamic calibration procedure which produced very large increases in the amount of 
Shallow Rutting and Deep Rutting. 
Additional information about the rut data changes may be found in “Description of FY 2006-
2007 Rutbar Changes” on page iii. 
As in previous years, the flexible pavement condition, distress, and ride quality trends drove the 
statewide trends.  This is because flexible pavement makes up almost all (92.31 percent) of the 
TxDOT-maintained mileage, but this percentage is slowly dropping as more rigid pavement 
(especially CRCP) is being built. 
Summary 
In FY 2007, ACP condition and distress got worse, but ride quality improved.  “Deep” distress 
on ACP mileage also improved because of a large reduction in Alligator Cracking.  ACP had the 
best overall condition and ride quality of the three major pavement types in FY 2007.  Shallow 
Rutting, Deep Rutting, Failures, and Longitudinal Cracking got worse in FY 2007; while 
Alligator Cracking, Transverse Cracking, Block Cracking, and Patching improved in FY 2007.

Chapter 4  Condition of Rigid Pavements — CRCP 
This chapter describes the condition of Continuously Reinforced Concrete Pavements (CRCP) in 
Texas.  They make up approximately 5.44 percent of the TxDOT-maintained lane mileage but 
carry 22.36 percent of the vehicle miles traveled. 
CRCP Distress Types 
The following distress type ratings are analyzed in this chapter: 
♦ Spalled Cracks 
♦ Punchouts 
♦ Asphalt Patches 
♦ Concrete Patches 
♦ Average Crack Spacing. 
 
NOTE: Due to the relatively small amount of mileage available when analyzing 
CRCP distresses by county, there are no maps shown in this chapter. 
Definition of “Shallow” and “Deep” Pavement Distress Types 
Rigid pavement distress can be caused by many factors, and local conditions have a major 
impact.  As with flexible pavements in Chapter 3, it is helpful to think of the CRCP distress types 
in PMIS in terms of: 
♦ “Shallow” Distress Types – Spalled Cracks and Concrete Patches.  Spalled Cracks 
usually indicate wear and tear of the concrete mix, or problems with weak or reactive 
aggregate.  Concrete Patches are assumed to be near-permanent repairs of distress 
(whether load-associated or not), that restore the structural strength of the concrete slab; 
thus they are not considered to be load-related. 
♦ “Deep” Distress Types – Punchouts and Asphalt Patches.  Punchouts indicate loss of 
structural load-carrying capacity.  Asphalt Patches are assumed to be temporary repairs of 
distress (whether load-associated or not), that do not restore the structural strength of the 
concrete slab; thus they are considered to be load-related. 
 
Distinguishing “Shallow” and “Deep” distress types can suggest how current funding needs to be 
distributed between preventive maintenance and rehabilitation.  It can also identify regions of the 
state where load-related structural problems are prevalent. 
Please note that Average Crack Spacing is not classified as “shallow” or “deep.”  It is used as a 
predictor of Punchouts for older CRCP sections less than about ten inches thick.  Experience 
with Texas pavements indicates that CRCP slabs greater than ten inches thick are not very 
sensitive to Average Crack Spacking.

Figure 4.4 shows the statewide distribution of Ride Score classes for CRCP pavements for fiscal 
years 2004 through 2007. In general, the average person would consider 17.96 percent of the 
continuously-reinforced concrete pavements to be “rough.” 
It should be noted that if an asphalt overlay is used to improve CRCP ride quality, PMIS 
considers that mileage to be “flexible,” and thus does not include it in these figures. 
17.04 percent of the CRCP lane miles had “Very Good” ride quality in FY 2007.

IRI Score Classes for CRCP 
Figure 4.5 shows the statewide distribution of IRI Score classes for CRCP pavements for fiscal 
years 2004 through 2007. In general, the average person would consider 72.32 percent of the 
continuously-reinforced concrete pavements to be “rough,” based on IRI.  This is not the same as 
the 17.96 percent of “rough” CRCP mileage based on Ride Score because the IRI categories are 
based on the construction specification for ride quality, and are not the same as the PMIS Ride 
Score categories. 
It should be noted that if an asphalt overlay is used to improve CRCP ride quality, PMIS 
considers that mileage to be “flexible,” and thus does not include it in these figures. 
1.46 percent of the CRCP lane miles had “Very Good” IRI Scores in FY 2007.

Spalled Cracks 
Figure 4.6 shows the percentage of PMIS sections with Spalled Cracks for fiscal years 2004 
through 2007. 
Spalled Cracks are transverse cracks that have widened, showing signs of chipping on either 
side, along some or all of their length.  If left untreated (or if they are spaced too closely 
together), Spalled Cracks can turn into Punchouts, which are much more serious to treat. 
19.43 percent of the CRCP sections had Spalled Cracks in FY 2007. 
 
Figure 4.6 — Spalled Cracks, FY 2004-2007. 
The Number of Spalled Cracks per Mile for CRCP show that the:

♦ “0 to 33” category decreased (from 18.23% in 2006 to 17.64% in 2007)

Punchouts 
Figure 4.7 shows the percentage of PMIS sections with Punchouts for fiscal years 2004 through 
2007. 
A Punchout is a full-depth block of pavement formed when one longitudinal crack crosses two 
transverse cracks.  Although usually rectangular in shape, Punchouts can appear in other shapes.  
Punchouts can be “removed” from the PMIS ratings by patching, so they must be looked at in 
combination with patches (especially Concrete Patches) to get a complete picture of concrete 
slab condition. 
8.65 percent of the CRCP sections had Punchouts in FY 2007. 
 
Figure 4.7 — Punchouts, FY 2004-2007. 
The Number of Punchouts per Mile for CRCP show that the:

Asphalt Patches 
Figure 4.8 shows the percentage of PMIS sections with Asphalt Patches for fiscal years 2004 
through 2007. 
An Asphalt Patch is a localized area of asphalt concrete that has been placed to the full depth of 
the surrounding concrete slab, as a temporary method of correcting surface or structural defects.  
These patches are usually placed to repair Punchouts, and the choice of material (asphalt or 
concrete) seems to depend on how quickly the repair must be made, with concrete being 
preferred if at all possible.  Asphalt patches of CRCP tend to be temporary repairs at best and 
thus have the same effect as Punchouts on the PMIS Distress Score. 
1.11 percent of the CRCP sections had Asphalt Patches in FY 2007.

A Concrete Patch is a localized area of newer concrete that has been placed to the full depth of 
the existing slab as a method of correcting surface or structural defects.  These patches are 
usually placed to repair Punchouts, and the choice of material (asphalt or concrete) seems to 
depend on how quickly the repair must be made, with concrete being preferred if at all possible.  
Concrete patches of CRCP tend to be long-lasting repairs. 
15.56 percent of the CRCP sections had Concrete Patches in FY 2007.

Average Crack Spacing 
Figure 4.10 shows the distribution of Average Crack Spacing on PMIS sections for fiscal years 
2004 through 2007. 
Average Crack Spacing in PMIS is defined as the average distance between transverse cracks, in 
feet.  Typically, CRCP starts out with transverse cracks about ten feet apart, and then the spacing 
decreases steadily as the pavement ages.  Research and field experience suggest that Punchouts 
tend to appear when the Average Crack Spacing drops below three feet, but thicker slabs — such 
as those being built today — seem to  be able to tolerate smaller transverse crack spacing without 
developing Spalled Cracks or Punchouts. 
0.93 percent of PMIS sections had an Average Crack Spacing less than three feet in FY 2007. 
 
Figure 4.10 — Average Crack Spacing, FY 2004-2007. 
The Average Crack Spacing for CRCP show that the:

Discussion 
In FY 2007, CRCP condition and distress improved, but ride quality got worse.  “Deep” distress 
(Spalled Cracks and Asphalt Patches) on CRCP improved in FY 2007. 
All CRCP distress types – Spalled Cracks, Punchouts, Asphalt Patches, and Concrete Patches – 
improved in FY 2007. 
CRCP ride quality got worse in FY 2007, as it did in FY 2006.  As a result, CRCP no longer has 
the best overall ride quality of the three major pavement types. 
As mentioned in Chapter 1, the cost of concrete pavement rose 11 percent in FY 2005 and 13 
percent in FY 2006, but these cost increases did not seem to have much effect on CRCP 
condition.  Concrete costs tend to be absorbed as part of the much larger cost of building new 
CRCP, which should be in very good condition, anyway.  For existing CRCP, concrete is 
typically used in smaller amounts for patching, so rapid increases in the cost of “paving” 
concrete are not as important. 
CRCP is often used in metropolitan areas and for routes carrying very high volumes of truck 
traffic.  Pavement problems on CRCP can thus seriously detract from the overall quality of 
service provided by Texas pavements, and need to be monitored carefully.  Although well-
designed and well-built CRCP can provide many years of maintenance-free service, it can be 
very difficult to repair once distress and roughness appear with age.  As a result, overall 
condition on CRCP in Texas tends to be lower than that on ACP, but the gap has been closing in 
recent years, especially as more new CRCP has been built. 
Summary 
In FY 2007, CRCP condition and distress improved, but ride quality got worse.  “Deep” distress 
(Spalled Cracks and Asphalt Patches) on CRCP also improved in FY 2007.  All CRCP distress 
types – Spalled Cracks, Punchouts, Asphalt Patches, and Concrete Patches – improved in FY 
2007.  CRCP no longer has the best overall ride quality of the three major pavement types.
136 Chapter 4 Condition of Texas Pavements, FY 2004-2007 
Several portions of PMIS were prototyped in the mid-1980s as 
part of a maintenance/pavement management system used in 
the Pharr district.  The Pharr system used 0.5-mile rating 
sections instead of the 2-mile sections used in the Pavement 
Evaluation System (PES).  The 0.5-mile section idea was later 
adopted as part of PMIS.  The Pharr system also had three 
area levels and three severity levels for each distress type, but 
these were not adopted as part of PMIS.

Chapter 5  Condition of Rigid Pavements — JCP 
This chapter describes the condition of Jointed Concrete Pavements (JCP) in Texas.  They make 
up approximately 2.26 percent of the TxDOT-maintained lane mileage but carry 5.25 percent of 
the vehicle miles traveled. 
JCP Distress Types 
The following distress type ratings are analyzed in this chapter: 
♦ Failed Joints and Cracks 
♦ JCP Failures 
♦ Shattered Slabs 
♦ Slabs with Longitudinal Cracks 
♦ Concrete Patches. 
 
NOTE: Due to the relatively small amount of mileage available when analyzing 
JCP distresses by county, there are no maps shown in this chapter. 
Causes of JCP Distress Types 
Rigid pavement distress can be caused by many factors, and local conditions have a major 
impact.  As with CRCP pavements in Chapter 4, it is helpful to think of the JCP distress types in 
PMIS in terms of: 
♦ “Shallow” Distress Types – Failed Joints and Cracks and Concrete Patches.  Failed Joints 
and Cracks can indicate loss of load transfer at the joints, but they identify areas of 
simple wear and tear of the concrete mix.  Concrete Patches are assumed to be near-
permanent repairs of distress (whether load-associated or not), that restore the structural 
strength of the concrete slab; thus they are not considered to be load-related. 
♦ “Deep” Distress Types – Failures, Shattered Slabs, and Slabs with Longitudinal Cracks.  
These distress types indicate loss of structural load-carrying capacity that require 
extensive repair or even slab replacement to restore the pavement structure. 
 
Distinguishing “Shallow” and “Deep” distress types can suggest how current funding needs to be 
distributed between preventive maintenance and rehabilitation.  It can also identify regions of the 
state where load-related structural problems are prevalent.
138 Chapter 5 Condition of Texas Pavements, FY 2004-2007 
In 1930, the “Texas Highway Department” had only 18 
districts (known then as “Divisions”), numbered 1 through 18.  
Districts numbered 19 through 25 (today’s Atlanta, Beaumont, 
Pharr, Laredo, Brownwood, El Paso, and Childress districts) 
were established later.

Ride Score Classes for JCP 
Figure 5.4 shows the statewide distribution of Ride Score classes for JCP pavements for fiscal 
years 2004 through 2007.  In general, the average person would consider 50.94 percent of the 
jointed concrete pavements to be “rough.”  
It should be noted that if an asphalt overlay is used to improve JCP ride quality, PMIS considers 
that mileage to be “flexible,” and thus does not include it in these figures. 
7.32 percent of the JCP lane miles had “Very Good” ride quality in FY 2007. 
 
Figure 5.4 — Ride Score Classes for JCP, FY 2004-2007. 
The Ride Score Classes for JCP show that: 
♦ “Very Good” mileage increased (from 6.68% in 2006 to 7.32% in 2007) 
♦ “Good” mileage increased (from 38.85% in 2006 to 41.73% in 2007) 
♦ “Fair” mileage decreased (from 48.62% in 2006 to 45.48% in 2007)

IRI Score Classes for JCP 
Figure 5.5 shows the statewide distribution of IRI Score classes for JCP pavements for fiscal 
years 2004 through 2007.  In general, the average person would consider 87.51 percent of the 
jointed concrete pavements to be “rough,” based on IRI.  This is not the same as the 50.94 
percent of “rough” JCP mileage based on Ride Score because the IRI categories are based on the 
construction specification for ride quality, and are not the same as the PMIS Ride Score 
categories. 
It should be noted that if an asphalt overlay is used to improve JCP ride quality, PMIS considers 
that mileage to be “flexible,” and thus does not include it in these figures. 
0.37 percent of the JCP lane miles had “Very Good” IRI Scores in FY 2007.

Failed Joints and Cracks 
Figure 5.6 shows the percentage of PMIS sections with Failed Joints and Cracks for fiscal years 
2004 through 2007. 
Failed Joints and Cracks looks at joints and transverse cracks in terms of two items: Spalling and 
Asphalt Patches.  Joints or transverse cracks that are not spalled or have been adequately repaired 
with concrete are not rated. 
40.63 percent of the JCP sections had Failed Joints and Cracks in FY 2007.

JCP Failures 
Figure 5.7 shows the percentage of PMIS sections with JCP Failures for fiscal years 2004 
through 2007. 
JCP Failures are localized areas of surface distortion or disintegration such as Corner Breaks, 
Punchouts, Asphalt Patches, failed Concrete Patches, D-shaped cracking at the joints (not 
commonly observed in Texas), spalled cracks, and popouts.  
JCP Failures can be “removed” from the PMIS ratings if they are patched with concrete and the 
patch remains in good condition (asphalt patches are still rated as Failures). 
37.06 percent of the JCP sections had JCP Failures in FY 2007.

Figure 5.9 shows the percentage of PMIS sections having Slabs with Longitudinal Cracks for 
fiscal years 2004 through 2007. 
Longitudinal Cracks are cracks that roughly parallel the roadbed centerline, but for PMIS 
purposes, the crack must be spalled or faulted to be included in the rating.

Concrete Patches 
Figure 5.10 shows the percentage of PMIS sections with Concrete Patches for fiscal years 2004

A Concrete Patch is a localized area of newer concrete that has been placed to the full depth of 
the existing slab as a method of correcting surface or structural defects.  These patches are 
usually placed to repair JCP Failures, but they are also used to repair joints and cracks. 
Concrete patches that have deteriorated with age are rated as JCP Failures in PMIS if the patch 
edges are spalled or faulted (similar in appearance to Punchouts on CRCP). 
29.92 percent of the JCP sections had Concrete Patches in FY 2007.

Discussion 
JCP condition and ride quality improved, but distress got very slightly worse in FY 2007.   
“Deep” distress (Failures, Shattered Slabs, and Slabs with Longitudinal Cracks) on JCP 
improved in FY 2007. 
Three of the five JCP distress types improved in FY 2007:  Failed Joints and Cracks, Failures, 
and Shattered Slabs.  The other two distress types – Slabs with Longitudinal Cracks and 
Concrete Patches – got worse in FY 2007. 
JCP ride quality continues to be a statewide problem, despite the improvement in FY 2007.  The 
percentage of JCP lane miles with “Very Good” ride quality is only 7.32 percent and the average 
person would consider 50.94 percent of the JCP mileage “rough” in FY 2007.  By comparison, 
the FY 2007 values for CRCP were 17.04 percent “Very Good” and 17.96 percent “rough,” and 
the values for ACP were 26.28 percent “Very Good” and 24.25 percent “rough.” 
JCP roughness problems are aggravated by the fact that it is often used in metropolitan areas 
where traffic volumes are high and loads are heavy.  The high traffic makes it more difficult to 
schedule and perform necessary maintenance on the slabs and joints.  The poor ride quality on 
these pavements lowers the overall quality of service to the public and increases the likelihood of 
pavement (and truck) damage caused by roughness-induced dynamic loading. 
Experience has shown that it is difficult to rate JCP distress in the field.  Large fluctuations in 
ratings from year to year are common, especially on pavements with multiple distress types.  The 
fluctuations since FY 2001 have not been as large, though, because many of the same raters have 
rated the pavements in all five years.  
JCP continues to have the most overall distress, the most “deep” distress, the roughest ride 
quality, and the worst overall condition of the three major pavement types in Texas.  Most JCP 
mileage is still in either in “Very Good” or “Very Poor” condition. 
Summary 
JCP condition and ride quality improved, but distress got very slightly worse in FY 2007.   
“Deep” distress (Failures, Shattered Slabs, and Slabs with Longitudinal Cracks) on JCP also 
improved.  Failed Joints and Cracks, Failures, and Shattered Slabs improved in FY 2007, but  
Slabs with Longitudinal Cracks and Concrete Patches got worse.
152 Chapter 5 Condition of Texas Pavements, FY 2004-2007 
TxDOT has been performing annual pavement evaluations 
since September 1982.  The first ratings were done on a five 
percent random sample of asphalt pavements on the State-
maintained network.  Three districts - Lufkin, San Antonio, 
and Pharr (then known as Districts 11, 15, and 21, 
respectively) - chose to rate all of their mileage instead of using 
the five percent random sample.  Concrete pavement ratings 
were not added until September 1984.
Condition of Texas Pavements, FY 2004-2007 Chapter 6 153 
Chapter 6  Maintenance Level of Service 
Previous chapters have described the condition of Texas pavements in terms of PMIS Scores 
(Distress, Ride, and Condition) and distress ratings.  Another way of describing condition is to 
compare the PMIS results to pre-defined pavement maintenance standards. 
Description of Maintenance Level of Service 
In 1992, TxDOT Administration approved a set of internal standards of evaluating and tracking 
the level of service provided by pavement maintenance at any given amount of funding.  These 
levels of service are defined as: 
♦ “Desirable” 
♦ “Acceptable” 
♦ “Tolerable” 
♦ “Intolerable.” 
 
These levels of service are based on PMIS data for: 
♦ Rutting 
♦ Alligator Cracking 
♦ Ride Quality. 
 
Traffic is a factor in the level of service definitions.  A high-traffic road must have lower 
amounts of distress and smoother ride quality to provide the same level of service as a low-traffic 
road.  Traffic categories for maintenance level of service are: 
♦ “Low” (1-500 vehicles per day) 
♦ “Medium” (501-10,000 vehicles per day) 
♦ “High” (10,001 or more vehicles per day). 
 
Each pavement section can have up to three levels of service, depending on the PMIS data.  For 
example, a pavement section can be “Desirable” in terms of Rutting, “Acceptable” in terms of 
Alligator Cracking, and “Tolerable” in terms of Ride Quality. 
There is a fourth level of service — “Combined”  — that describes the overall level of service 
that a pavement section provides.  This is defined as the worst of the three other levels of service.  
In the example above, the pavement section’s “Combined” level of service would be “Tolerable” 
because of the ride quality. 
NOTE: Maintenance levels of service are only defined for flexible pavements 
(ACP) at this time, thus this chapter only analyzes flexible pavements.  
Rigid pavement (CRCP and JCP) levels of service have not been 
defined.
154 Chapter 6 Condition of Texas Pavements, FY 2004-2007 
PMIS began with an approximately 50-percent sample for 
distress ratings and ride quality measurements.  The sample 
was all IH mileage and half of the non-IH mileage.  The non-IH 
mileage was not sampled randomly, though, but was selected 
from county line to county line, with half of a district's non-IH 
mileage getting new data in even-numbered years and the 
other half getting data in odd-numbered years.

Rutting Level of Service 
Figure 6.1 shows the statewide distribution for Rutting level of service for fiscal years 2004 
through 2007. 
Please note that the level of service definitions have been changed to treat 1 percent Rutting the 
same as 0 percent Rutting.  This was done to account for sensor “noise” typically observed in the 
acoustic sensors used to measure Rutting. 
52.57 percent of the flexible lane miles was “Desirable” in terms of Rutting in FY 2007. 
 
Figure 6.1 — Rutting Level of Service, FY 2004-2007. 
The Rutting Level of Service shows that: 
♦ “Desirable” mileage decreased (from 68.29% in 2006 to 52.57% in 2007) 
♦ “Acceptable” mileage increased (from 23.93% in 2006 to 36.07% in 2007) 
♦ “Tolerable” mileage increased (from 7.59% in 2006 to 10.89% in 2007) 
♦ “Intolerable” mileage increased (from 0.19% in 2006 to 0.47% in 2007). 
 
TxDOT experience with the automated rut-measuring equipment (“Rutbar”) suggests that these 
PMIS results are a minimum estimate of the amount of rutting that actually exists on the road.  
Because the sensors on the Rutbar are fixed in positions less than the full width of the lane, some 
pavement rutting that exists on the road might not be shown in these PMIS measurements.

Maps 6.1 and 6.2 on the following pages show Rutting level of service in each county for fiscal 
years 2006 and 2007.  These maps show the percentage of lane miles in each county that were 
maintained at a “Desirable” or “Acceptable” level of service.  Counties in red had the lowest 
Rutting level of service, while counties in blue had the highest Rutting level of service. 
The percentage of lane miles with “Desirable” or “Acceptable” level of service for Rutting 
decreased in FY 2007.  The amount of Shallow Rutting and Deep Rutting increased, as described 
in Chapter 3. 
Rutting increased even after subtracting 0.1 inches from each rut depth measurement.  This was 
done to compensate for a change in the Rutbar dynamic calibration procedure back in FY 2006 
which had produced very large increases in the amount of Shallow Rutting and Deep Rutting. 
Additional information about the FY 2007 Rutbar changes may be found in “Description of FY 
2006-2007 Rutbar Changes” on page iii. 
The adjusted Rutting data also affected the “Combined” maintenance level of service results, as 
will be discussed later in this Chapter.

Alligator Cracking Level of Service 
Figure 6.2 shows the statewide distribution for Alligator Cracking level of service for fiscal years 
2004 through 2007. 
85.00 percent of flexible lane miles was “Desirable” in terms of Alligator Cracking in FY 2007. 
 
Figure 6.2 — Alligator Cracking  Level of Service, FY 2004-2007. 
The Alligator Cracking Level of Service shows that: 
♦ “Desirable” mileage increased (from 84.73% in 2006 to 85.00% in 2007) 
♦ “Acceptable” mileage increased (from 12.00% in 2006 to 12.24% in 2007) 
♦ “Tolerable” mileage decreased (from 2.90% in 2006 to 2.53% in 2007) 
♦ “Intolerable” mileage decreased (from 0.36% in 2006 to 0.24% in 2007).

Maps 6.3 and 6.4 on the following pages show Alligator Cracking level of service in each county 
for fiscal years 2006 and 2007.  These maps show the percentage of lane miles in each county 
that were maintained at a “Desirable” or “Acceptable” level of service.  Counties in red had the 
lowest Alligator Cracking level of service, while counties in blue had the highest Alligator 
Cracking level of service. 
The percentage of lane miles with “Desirable” or “Acceptable” level of service for Alligator 
Cracking increased slightly in FY 2007.  This trend is consistent with the improvement in 
Alligator Cracking described in Chapter 3. 
Small changes in Alligator Cracking usually do not show up in the level of service percentages 
because they are so broadly defined.  For example, if a PMIS section changes from 5 to 10 
percent Alligator Cracking, it will remain in the “Acceptable” level of service category (which is 
1-10 percent); and if it changes from 15 to 20 percent, it will remain in the “Tolerable” category 
(which is 11-50 percent).  However, small amounts of “new” Alligator Cracking on sections that 
previously had none will change the level of service from “Desirable” to “Acceptable” or maybe 
even to “Tolerable.” 
Almost all of the Alligator Cracking that does exist in Texas is in the 1-15 percent range, and 
these small amounts of Alligator Cracking can be quickly eliminated with in-place base repair or 
thin surface patches.

♦ “Acceptable” mileage decreased (from 15.89% in 2006 to 15.54% in 2007) 
♦ “Tolerable” mileage decreased (from 5.93% in 2006 to 5.91% in 2007)

Maps 6.5 and 6.6 on the following pages show Ride Quality level of service in each county for 
fiscal years 2006 and 2007.  These maps show the percentage of lane miles in each county that 
were maintained at a “Desirable” or “Acceptable” level of service.  Counties in red had the 
lowest Ride Quality level of service, while counties in blue had the highest Ride Quality level of 
service. 
The percentage of lane miles with “Desirable” or “Acceptable” level of service for Ride Quality 
decreased in FY 2007.  This trend does not match the observed improvement in overall ACP 
Ride Quality described in Chapter 3, because of an increase in the number of lane miles rated in 
FY 2007.  There were actually 679.2 more lane miles in “Desirable” or “Acceptable” level of 
service in FY 2007.  These additional lane miles made the overall Ride Quality in Chapter 3 go 
up, but they were not enough to offset the 828.1 additional lane miles rated that drove down the 
level of service percentage. 
It should be noted that the Ride Quality level of service definitions are based in part on traffic.  
This means that high-traffic roads must have better ride quality to provide “Desirable” or 
“Acceptable” level of service.  As a result, it is harder for urban and metropolitan counties to 
show up as having “Desirable” or “Acceptable” level of service for Ride Quality because of their 
higher traffic volumes.  Of course, those higher traffic volumes also make it more difficult to 
maintain good ride quality.

Maps 6.7 and 6.8 on the following pages show Combined level of service in each county for 
fiscal years 2006 and 2007.  These maps show the percentage of lane miles in each county that 
were maintained at a “Desirable” or “Acceptable” level of service.  Counties in red had the 
lowest Combined level of service, while counties in blue had the highest Combined level of 
service. 
The percentage of lane miles with “Desirable” or “Acceptable” level of service for “Combined” 
decreased in FY 2007, because of worsening Rutting and Ride Quality. 
As mentioned earlier in this Chapter, the FY 2007 Rutting data in PMIS was adjusted by 
subtracting 0.1 inches from each rut depth measurement to compensate for a change in the 
Rutbar dynamic calibration procedure.  Despite these adjustments, Rutting got worse statewide 
in FY 2007 and helped reduce the overall “Combined” level of service. 
However, even with the drop in overall “Combined” level of service, more than 80 percent of 
Texas flexible pavements still provided “Desirable” or “Acceptable” level of service in FY 2007. 
The “Combined” maintenance level of service is a “combination” of the worst of the other three 
levels of service.  It is very difficult to improve “Combined” level of service because it requires 
the same mileage to improve in distress and ride quality.  Such improvement usually requires 
rehabilitation-type treatments such as thin/thick overlays or in-place base repair to correct sub-
surface structural problems.  Thin surface treatments usually do not improve “Combined” level 
of service because they do not substantially improve ride quality.  Even worse is the fact that 
small increases in Rutting, Alligator Cracking, or small declines in Ride Quality levels of service 
can produce very large reductions in “Combined” level of service.

ratings still started in September of each year.
Condition of Texas Pavements, FY 2004-2007 Chapter 6 173 
Combined Maintenance Level of Service, by Traffic Category 
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the maintenance levels of service are defined by traffic.  
High-traffic roads must have lower amounts of distress and smoother ride quality to provide the 
same level of service as low-traffic roads.  Figures 6.5 and 6.6 show the distribution of the 
Combined Maintenance level of service percentages, by traffic category, for fiscal years 2006 
and 2007. 
These distributions show that the overall level of service provided by Texas flexible pavements 
got worse in FY 2007, because of declines in “Low-traffic” and “Medium-traffic” mileage. 
“Low-traffic” roads got worse in FY 2007.  “Desirable” mileage (the blue slices) dropped by ten 
percent and “Acceptable” mileage (the green slices) rose by seven percent.  “Tolerable” mileage 
(the yellow slices) rose by three percent.  “Intolerable” mileage (the red slices) stayed the same 
at 1 percent. 
“Low-traffic” roads accounted for 26.90 percent of the lane miles but only 1.62 percent of the 
vehicles miles traveled in FY 2007. Both of these percentages decreased in FY 2007. 
“Medium-traffic” roads also got worse in FY 2007, and showed exactly the same trends as the 
“Low-traffic” roads.  “Desirable” mileage dropped by ten percent, “Acceptable” mileage rose by 
seven percent, “Tolerable” mileage rose by three percent, and “Intolerable” mileage stayed the 
same at 1 percent. 
“Medium-traffic” roads accounted for 59.21 percent of the lane miles and 42.13 percent of the 
vehicles miles traveled in FY 2007.  The percentage of lane miles increased, but the percentage 
of vehicle miles traveled decreased in FY 2007. 
“High-traffic” roads stayed the same overall in FY 2007.  A seven percent drop in “Desirable” 
mileage was matched by a seven percent rise in “Acceptable” mileage, and a one percent drop in 
“Acceptable” mileage was matched by a one percent rise in “Intolerable” mileage. 
“High-traffic” roads accounted for only 13.89 percent of the lane miles but 56.25 percent of the 
vehicles miles traveled in FY 2007.  Both of these percentages increased in FY 2007. 
From a public service standpoint, it is preferable to have high-traffic roads in the best condition, 
but from a pavement standpoint this is difficult to do because of the higher traffic volumes and 
loads.  Safety, congestion, user delay, and scheduling add to the problem of not being able to get 
out on the road to do preventive maintenance to keep the road in good condition.  The problem is 
that when preventive maintenance is not done when needed, pavement condition drops, the 
overall level of service provided to the public drops, and the cost to repair the pavement 
increases.  Depending on the time delay and type of pavement, the increased cost can be five- to 
seven-times (or more) of the original preventive maintenance treatment cost.  These increases 
only relate to the increased cost of materials and construction labor to repair the pavement and do 
not take into account additional cost increases due to motorist time delays within construction 
zones.

How times change:  Back before World War I, the phrase 
“good roads” in Texas had a different meaning.  “Come to 
Texas if you want to see good roads,” a turn-of-the-century 
Bell County farmer growled; “good and rough, good and 
muddy.”  In 1925, the Federal Bureau of Public Roads shut off 
all federal highway aid to Texas because of the poor state of 
maintenance.  In 1928, Texas was spending $495 per mile for 
maintenance, with most of the money spent for work trying to 
satisfy the Bureau of Public Roads to regain federal aid.  
Today, Texas highways consistently rate as the best in the 
country, according to Overdrive Magazine surveys of trucking 
owners and operators.

Discussion 
The overall “Combined” level of service maintained on Texas flexible (ACP) pavements got 
worse in FY 2007, despite an improved level of service for Alligator Cracking. 
The percentage of lane miles with “Desirable” or “Acceptable” level of service for Rutting 
decreased in FY 2007 because of increases in the amount of Shallow Rutting and Deep Rutting.  
Please note that the level of service definitions in this report were changed to treat 1 percent 
Rutting the same as 0 percent Rutting.  This was done to account for sensor “noise” typically 
observed in the acoustic sensors used to measure Rutting.  This change reduced – but did not 
reverse – the increase in the amount of Rutting. 
The percentage of lane miles with “Desirable” or “Acceptable” level of service for Alligator 
Cracking increased slightly in FY 2007.  This trend was consistent with the improvement in 
Alligator Cracking described in Chapter 3. 
The percentage of lane miles with “Desirable” or “Acceptable” level of service for Ride Quality 
decreased in FY 2007.  This trend does not match the observed improvement in overall ACP 
Ride Quality described in Chapter 3, because of an increase in the number of lane miles rated in 
FY 2007.  There were actually 679.2 more lane miles in “Desirable” or “Acceptable” level of 
service in FY 2007.  These additional lane miles made the overall Ride Quality in Chapter 3 go 
up, but they were not enough to offset the 828.1 additional lane miles rated that drove down the 
level of service percentage. 
The overall level of service for “Low-traffic” and “Medium-traffic” mileage got worse, while 
“High-traffic” level of service did not change in FY 2007.  “High-traffic” roads continued to 
carry the majority of vehicle miles traveled — 56.25 percent in FY 2007 — despite being only 
13.89 percent of the lane miles.  This means that more than half of the public’s perception of the 
overall quality of Texas pavements was based on the condition of these “high-traffic” roads.   
The maintenance level of service results shown in this chapter only apply to flexible (ACP) 
pavement.  Rigid pavements (CRCP and JCP) do not yet have level of service definitions for 
pavement maintenance, but these could be developed at any time based on the PMIS distress 
ratings, ride quality measurements, and other factors. 
Summary 
The overall “Combined” level of service maintained on Texas flexible (ACP) pavements got 
worse in FY 2007, despite an improved level of service for Alligator Cracking.  “Low-traffic” 
and “Medium-traffic” mileage got worse, while “High-traffic” level of service did not change in 
FY 2007.

Chapter 7  Performance Measures 
This report has shown that there are many ways to describe the condition of Texas pavements.  
No matter which method is used, the intent is the same:  to produce pavements that provide safe 
and efficient transport of people and goods.  To meet this intent, TxDOT defines performance 
measures and adjusts funding, as necessary, to improve the overall condition of Texas 
pavements.  These performance measures are then used for TxDOT pavement management, for 
funding of pavement projects in the annual Unified Transportation Program (UTP), and for 
National strategic planning. 
Performance Measures Analyzed in This Chapter 
This chapter reports the FY 2004-2007 PMIS data in terms of the following performance 
measures: 
♦ Statewide Pavement Condition Goal – Percentage of Lane Miles in “Good” or Better 
Condition 
♦ UTP Category 1 — Preventive Maintenance and Rehabilitation 
♦ FHWA Strategic Goal for NHS Ride Quality. 
 
Overview of the Statewide Pavement Condition Goal 
In August 2001, the Texas Transportation Commission set a goal to have 90 percent of Texas 
pavement lane miles in “Good” or better condition within the next ten years (that is, by FY 
2012).  “Good or better” was defined as a PMIS Condition Score of 70 or above.  In July 2002, 
TxDOT Administration established specific two- and ten-year goals for each district, using FY 
2002 PMIS results as the baseline. 
PMIS-related performance measures show mixed condition trends for FY 2007.  The statewide 
pavement condition goal percentage of lane miles in “Good” or better condition increased from 
86.69 percent in FY 2006 to 86.76 percent in FY 2007.  For UTP Category 1, the Distress Score 
1-59 measure improved, but the Distress Score 70-89 and Ride Score 0.1-1.9 measures got 
worse.  The Federal ride quality performance measures all improved in FY 2007. 
Additional information about the statewide pavement condition goal may be found in Status of 
Statewide Pavement Condition Goal, FY 2004-2007 (Executive Summary or Full Version).  
These reports are available from the Construction Division, Materials and Pavements Section.

PMIS sample increased to 100 percent in FY 2001, TxDOT 
published a two-year report for FY 2001-2002 and a three-year

goal by county, for FY 2006 and FY 2007 respectively.  The percentages are weighted by lane 
miles, and include all mainlanes and frontage roads.  Counties in blue already meet the statewide 
pavement condition goal (90 percent or more “Good” or better), while counties in red are well 
below the goal (less than 70 percent “Good” or better). 
In all maps, the percentages are weighted by lane miles, and include all mainlanes and frontage 
roads.  Counties in blue already meet the statewide pavement condition goal (90 percent or more 
“Good” or better), while counties in red are well below the goal (less than 70 percent “Good” or 
better). 
The maps show the slight improvement of statewide pavement condition from FY 2006 to FY 
2007.

FHWA Headquarters Strategic Plan for NHS Ride Quality 
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) headquarters office recently established a 
strategic plan for ride quality on the National Highway System (NHS).  The plan included two 
new performance measures and then proposed to adjust annual goals as necessary to improve 
NHS ride quality. 
Table 7.14 shows results for the first measure:  percentage of NHS mainlane vehicle miles 
traveled (VMT) with “Good” smoothness, for fiscal years 2004 through 2007.  “Good” 
smoothness is defined as IRI of 1-95 inches per mile (same as PMIS Ride Score of 3.8 or above). 
48.54 percent of the mainlane NHS VMT had IRI between 1 and 95 in FY 2007.

Statewide Pavement Condition Goal — Total Lane Miles Rated 
The statewide pavement condition goal includes all mainlanes and frontage roads rated during 
the annual PMIS pavement evaluation cycle, which begins in September of each fiscal year and 
usually lasts until February.  The percentage of lane miles rated influences the expected 
reliability of the reported “Good or better” value — higher percentages of  lane miles rated are 
expected to be more reliable than lower percentages. 
Table 7.17 shows the percentage of lane miles (mainlanes and frontage roads) rated for fiscal 
years 2004 through 2005.

202 Chapter 7 Condition of Texas Pavements, FY 2004-2007 
US 81 and US 287 in Montague County are paved with gold. 
When 39 miles of these roadways were paved in 1936, sand 
taken from a local pit was mixed with paving material. The 
sand contained gold but in small amounts. According to a 
roadside historical marker, the gold in the sand was valued at 
54 cents per ton, or $31,000 in these sections of highway.
Condition of Texas Pavements, FY 2004-2007 Chapter 7 203 
Discussion 
PMIS-related performance measures show mixed condition trends for FY 2007.  The statewide 
pavement condition goal percentage of lane miles in “Good” or better condition increased from 
86.69 percent in FY 2006 to 86.76 percent in FY 2007.  For UTP Category 1, the Distress Score 
1-59 measure improved, but the Distress Score 70-89 and Ride Score 0.1-1.9 measures got 
worse.  The Federal ride quality performance measures all improved in FY 2007. 
As mentioned in Chapter 1, overall statewide condition got slightly worse in FY 2007 mainly 
because of increased distress on asphalt pavements.  Overall pavement distress got worse, but 
overall ride quality improved.  The performance measures do not necessarily describe overall 
conditions – they only describe the amount of mileage above or below an arbitrary value.  It is 
possible for them to contradict the overall trends, which is what happened in FY 2007. 
Three factors affect the results of the performance measures:  1) what is happening to the 
mileage above the standard; 2) the amount of mileage below the standard; and 3) the total 
amount of mileage actually on the highway system. 
For example, if every mile of pavement in Texas had a PMIS Condition Score of 100 in FY 
2006, the percentage of lane miles in “Good” or better condition would be 100 percent.  If in FY 
2007 every one of those miles dropped to 70, the percentage of lane miles in “Good” or better 
condition would not have changed (still 100 percent), but the overall condition would have 
dropped substantially. 
For the UTP and Federal performance measures, the amount of mileage below the standard can 
change because “good” mileage gets worse and drops in, or because “bad” mileage improves and 
rises out. 
Changes in the total amount of mileage on the highway system can also affect the performance 
measures.  Small increases in “below standard” mileage can be offset by large increases in total 
mileage, especially when new mileage (which is usually “above standard”) is added. 
Summary 
PMIS-related performance measures show mixed condition trends for FY 2007.  The statewide 
pavement condition goal percentage of lane miles in “Good” or better condition increased from 
86.69 percent in FY 2006 to 86.76 percent in FY 2007.  For UTP Category 1, the Distress Score 
1-59 measure improved, but the Distress Score 70-89 and Ride Score 0.1-1.9 measures got 
worse.  The Federal ride quality performance measures all improved in FY 2007.

Chapter 8 Estimate of Pavement Needs 
Previous chapters have described the condition of Texas pavements in terms of PMIS distress 
ratings and ride quality measurements.  PMIS also uses this data to estimate pavement needs 
(lane miles and funding) for any given year. 
The PMIS Needs Estimate program uses pre-defined criteria to propose broad categories of 
treatments.  These treatments are: 
♦ Needs Nothing (no treatment needed at this time) 
♦ Preventive Maintenance (such as a seal coat or crack seal) 
♦ Light Rehabilitation (such as a thin hot-mix overlay) 
♦ Medium Rehabilitation (such as slab repair or thick hot-mix overlay) 
♦ Heavy Rehabilitation (such as a new flexible or rigid pavement). 
 
This estimate is provided to show trends only – it is not a total estimate of all pavement-related 
needs. 
Needs Estimate treatments are based on pavement distress and ride quality, along with other 
factors such as traffic, number of lanes, and functional classification.  They are not directly based 
on Distress Score or Condition Score because these scores do not contain enough detailed 
information to identify the type of treatment needed.  As a result, Needs Estimate trends can 
occasionally disagree with Distress Score and Condition Score trends. 
The lane mile estimates shown in this chapter can be used to monitor relationships between 
preventive maintenance (PM) and rehabilitation needs.  The funding estimates can be used to 
evaluate the adequacy and distribution of pavement funds. 
Unlike previous Condition of Texas Pavements reports, the Statewide pavement needs shown in 
this report have not been extrapolated.  They are the total lane miles and funding needed to repair 
all
 “substandard” Texas pavements, based on FY2003 through FY 2007 PMIS data. 
It should be noted that these PMIS Needs Estimate results only cover pavement-related expenses.  
They do not cover right-of-way, bridge repair, capacity, safety, traffic control, or other roadside 
improvement costs.  They also do not include adjustments for changes in treatment costs over 
time because such adjustments would make it harder to track trends over time. 
Please note that the PM Needs Estimate results for FY 2003-2005 in this report do not exactly 
match those that have been published in previous Condition of Texas Pavements reports.  This is 
because the Needs Estimate contains a PM treatment for those PMIS sections that were last 
surfaced more than 7 years ago, and that this information is continuously being added to PMIS.  
For example, if a PMIS section was last surfaced in July 1995, but the surface date information 
was not added until January 2006, it would have showed up as “Needs Nothing” for FY 2003-
2005 in last year’s report, but will show up as “PM” for FY 2004-2006 in this year’s report.

Location of Preventive Maintenance Needs, FY 2006-2007 
Maps 8.1 and 8.2 show preventive maintenance needs in each county for fiscal years 2006 and 
2007.  Counties in blue have the lowest need (less than $250,000) while counties in red have the 
highest need (more than $2,000,000). 
Preventive maintenance needs increased from $248 million in FY 2006 to $275 million in FY 
2007, mainly because of increased Deep Rutting on ACP mileage.  Treatments triggered by 
pavement age, ACP Failures, ACP Shallow Rutting, and ACP Longitudinal Cracking also went 
up.  The Deep Rutting preventive maintenance treatments affected nearly 11,900 lane miles. 
Increased amounts of Patching do not show up in the Needs Estimate because PMIS does not 
have any treatments specifically related to Patching.  In essence, Patching is the treatment.  This 
was not affected by the decision to remove ACP Patching from the PMIS Condition Score 
equation in FY 2007. 
The improved FY 2007 Ride Quality had no effect on FY 2007 PM needs, because the PMIS 
Needs Estimate does not use PM treatments to “fix” ride quality. 
In PMIS, preventive maintenance primarily addresses non-load associated distress types on 
flexible pavements and JCP.  PMIS also uses preventive maintenance to address small amounts 
of “deep” distress if the pavement is still in relatively good condition (no ride quality problems 
or other extensive distress).  However, PMIS does not use preventive maintenance for CRCP or 
for correcting any kind of ride quality or subsurface structural problems.

Counties in blue have the lowest need (less than $1,250,000) while counties in red have the 
highest need (more than $10,000,000). 
Statewide rehab needs decreased from $1,411 million in FY 2006 to $1,389 million in FY 2007, 
mainly because of the improvement in overall statewide ride quality. 
Some rehab treatment types did increase, however.  Rehab treatments triggered by CRCP 
Punchouts, Asphalt Patches, and Concrete Patches increased.  Treatments for PMIS Ride Score 
less than 1.5 also increased, as suggested by the statewide increase in mileage with “Poor” ride 
quality (shown in Chapter 1). 
Ride quality continues to have a major effect on statewide rehab needs.  Of the seven rehab 
treatments that increased the most in FY 2007, six of them were triggered by ride quality. 
It should be noted that the PMIS Needs Estimate program places stricter standards for distress 
and ride quality in high-traffic areas, and these standards tend to produce higher estimated needs 
for metropolitan areas. 
In PMIS, rehabilitation primarily addresses load-associated distress types to restore pavement 
structural strength, especially on sections with large amounts of “deep” distress.  PMIS also uses 
rehabilitation to correct ride quality problems on rough roads.  Pavement sections with smaller 
amounts of distress, or sections that have not been resurfaced in more than seven years, show up 
in the PM needs portion of the Needs Estimate.

Distribution of Lane Mile and Funding Needs, FY 2006-2007 
Figure 8.9 shows the distribution of lane mile needs for fiscal years 2006 and 2007. 
The percentage of lane miles needing treatment increased from 31 percent in FY 2006 to 34 
percent in FY 2007, mainly because of increased amounts of flexible pavement distress.  The 
percentage of lane miles needing Preventive Maintenance increased by 3 percent, but the 
percentage of lane miles needing Rehabilitation stayed the same (12 percent). 
Figure 8.10 shows the distribution of funding needs for fiscal years 2006 and 2007. 
The Preventive maintenance share of the pavement needs increased from 15 percent in FY 2006 
to 17 percent in FY 2007.  Of course, this decreased the rehab share from 85 percent in FY 2006 
to 83 percent in FY 2007.  PMIS estimated more mileage needing repair in FY 2007, but at 
slightly less cost per lane mile so the total needs did not go up as much. 
Rehabilitation dominates funding percentages for the simple reason that the treatment costs are 
so much higher than preventive maintenance.  That is why both lane mile and funding 
percentages must be reviewed when assessing overall pavement needs. 
Figures 8.9 and 8.10 show the typical relationship between preventive maintenance and 
rehabilitation:  preventive maintenance does most of the work, but rehabilitation funds most of 
the work.  Using the FY 2007 results as an example, 16.54 percent of the total funding needs 
could be used for preventive maintenance to treat 21.56 percent of the lane miles; but it would 
take 83.46 percent of the total funding needs used for rehab to treat 12.03 percent of the lane 
miles.  Preventive maintenance would thus seem to provide “more bang for the buck,” but it 
would not provide the sub-surface structural repair that aging pavements need to carry current 
and future traffic volume and loads.  However, overemphasis on rehabilitation would leave a 
very large amount of mileage to deteriorate under climate and traffic, and that would cause future 
rehab needs to increase even more rapidly than before.  This would make it even harder to find 
the necessary funds to treat the deteriorating pavements effectively. 
This balance between preventive maintenance and rehabilitation is especially important when 
developing work programs to meet the statewide pavement condition goal (90 percent “Good” or 
better) described in Chapter 7.  This goal is essentially a rehab program.  In most cases, 
preventive maintenance is not substantial enough to adequately repair mileage with a PMIS 
Condition Score less than 70.  However, repairing the 10-15 percent of lane miles not
 in “Good” 
or better condition would take almost all of the current pavement funds, thus leaving nothing for 
repair of the 85-90 percent of the mileage that might drop below “Good” condition next year.

The longest highway in Texas is US 83.  It extends from the 
Oklahoma state line in the Panhandle near Perryton, to the 
Mexico border at Brownsville, 899 miles away.

Discussion 
Statewide pavement needs in Texas increased very slightly to $1,664 million in FY 2007, despite 
a drop in rehabilitation needs. 
Preventive maintenance needs increased from $248 million in FY 2006 to $275 million in FY 
2007, mainly because of increased Deep Rutting on ACP mileage.  Treatments triggered by 
pavement age, ACP Failures, ACP Shallow Rutting, and ACP Longitudinal Cracking also went 
up.  The Deep Rutting preventive maintenance treatments affected nearly 11,900 lane miles. 
Statewide rehab needs decreased from $1,411 million in FY 2006 to $1,389 million in FY 2007, 
mainly because of the improvement in overall statewide ride quality.  However, rehab treatments 
for PMIS Ride Score less than 1.5 increased because of the statewide increase in mileage with 
“Poor” ride quality (shown in Chapter 1).  Rehab treatments triggered by CRCP Punchouts, 
Asphalt Patches, and Concrete Patches also increased.   
This needs estimate is provided to show trends only – it is not a total estimate of all pavement-
related needs. 
As mentioned in Chapter 1, overall construction costs rose by more than 21 percent in FY 2005 
and by another 17 percent in FY 2006.  The PMIS Needs Estimate costs used in this Chapter date 
back to FY 1993 and have not
 been adjusted to account for changes in treatment costs over time, 
so actual pavement repair costs would be even higher than shown in this report.  Highway 
construction costs in Texas have risen by more than 97 percent since FY 1997.  Assuming a three 
percent per year inflation rate dating back to FY 1993 suggests that the PMIS Needs Estimate 
results in this chapter should be increased by 122 percent to reflect April 2007 construction costs. 
The PMIS Needs Estimate cost values in this Chapter are also only for pavement-related costs, 
and do not include right-of-way, bridge repair, capacity, safety, traffic control, or other roadside 
improvement costs. 
Summary 
Statewide pavement needs in Texas increased very slightly to $1,664 million in FY 2007, despite 
a drop in rehabilitation needs.  Preventive maintenance needs increased from $248 million in FY 
2006 to $275 million in FY 2007, mainly because of increased Deep Rutting on ACP mileage.  
Rehab needs decreased from $1,411 million in FY 2006 to $1,389 million in FY 2007, mainly 
because of the improvement in overall statewide ride quality.
226 Chapter 8 Condition of Texas Pavements, FY 2004-2007 
On January 20, 1974, the maximum speed limit in Texas was 
reduced to 55 mph.  About 17,200 signs were changed at a cost 
of about $621,000.  In December 1995, the speed limit returned 
to 70 mph, costing TxDOT about $8 million.

Chapter 9  Summary 
The overall condition of Texas pavements got slightly worse in FY 2007 mainly because of 
increased distress on asphalt pavements.  Overall pavement distress got worse, but overall ride 
quality improved.  A prolonged drought that began in mid-FY 2005 and lasted through all of FY 
2006, rising material costs, increased competition for limited construction materials, and 
increased oilfield development traffic contributed to the decline in statewide pavement condition. 
Pavement condition and distress trends were mixed, but ride quality improved for each of the 
four major highway systems (IH, US, SH, and FM) in FY 2007.  IH and SH routes improved in 
all categories – condition, distress, ride, and “deep” distress.  US highways improved in distress, 
“deep” distress, and ride, but the improvements were all very small, and were not enough to keep 
the overall condition from getting worse.  FM roads improved in ride quality, but got worse in 
condition, distress, and “deep” distress. 
ACP condition and distress got worse, but ride quality improved in FY 2007.  “Deep” distress on 
improved because of a large reduction in Alligator Cracking.  ACP had the best overall condition 
and ride quality of the three major pavement types in FY 2007.  Shallow Rutting, Deep Rutting, 
Failures, and Longitudinal Cracking got worse; while Alligator Cracking, Transverse Cracking, 
Block Cracking, and Patching improved. 
CRCP condition and distress improved, but ride quality got worse in FY 2007.  “Deep” distress 
(Spalled Cracks and Asphalt Patches) on CRCP also improved.  All CRCP distress types – 
Spalled Cracks, Punchouts, Asphalt Patches, and Concrete Patches – improved. 
JCP condition and ride quality improved, but distress got very slightly worse in FY 2007.   
“Deep” distress (Failures, Shattered Slabs, and Slabs with Longitudinal Cracks) on JCP also 
improved.  Failed Joints and Cracks, Failures, and Shattered Slabs improved, but  Slabs with 
Longitudinal Cracks and Concrete Patches got worse. 
The overall “Combined” level of service maintained on Texas flexible (ACP) pavements got 
worse in FY 2007, despite an improved level of service for Alligator Cracking.  “Low-traffic” 
and “Medium-traffic” mileage got worse, while “High-traffic” level of service did not change. 
PMIS-related performance measures show mixed condition trends for FY 2007.  The statewide 
pavement condition goal percentage of lane miles in “Good” or better condition increased from 
86.69 percent in FY 2006 to 86.76 percent in FY 2007.  For UTP Category 1, the Distress Score 
1-59 measure improved, but the Distress Score 70-89 and Ride Score 0.1-1.9 measures got 
worse.  The Federal ride quality performance measures all improved in FY 2007. 
Statewide pavement needs in Texas increased very slightly to $1,664 million in FY 2007, despite 
a drop in rehabilitation needs.  Preventive maintenance needs increased from $248 million in FY 
2006 to $275 million in FY 2007, mainly because of increased Deep Rutting on ACP mileage.  
Rehab needs decreased from $1,411 million in FY 2006 to $1,389 million in FY 2007, mainly 
because of the improvement in overall statewide ride quality.
